Illegal weapons are easily procured in urban open-air markets despite a government initiative launched in 2006 to curb the availability of arms . [MISC Kenyan] security minister [PER John Michuki] recently stated at a ceremony burning 8000 illegal arms seized in 2006 to prevent the spread of firearms -- Firearms fuel the illegal exploitation of natural resources and abet terrorism and other crimes . The easy affordability and accessibility of arms reduces incentives to pursue non-violent solutions to conflicts and initiates a spiral of insecurity . Police stated that conflicts along [LOC Kenya] 's borders have increased the number of weapons in the area . Conflicts include a 20-year insurgency in [LOC Uganda] , anarchy in [LOC Somalia] since 1991 and the former civil war in [LOC Sudan] .

[PER Lukyanov] thinks the [MISC Russian] government 's calculations are wrong and that a frightened [LOC Europe] will join with the [LOC United States] . [PER Lukyanov] said the decision to freeze the [ORG CFE] was part of a wider move by the [MISC Russian] government to use newly found strength to remold the foundations of transatlantic relations and that the [MISC Russian] government wants to revise the forces influencing interaction in the Euro-Atlantic area that were set when [LOC Russia] was weaker . Political analyst and director of [LOC Moscow] 's Institute for globalization [PER Boris Kagarlitsky] said the [MISC Russian] government also appears to be using its geopolitical strength to put pressure on [LOC Europe] over business ties . [PER Kagarlitsky] said the withdrawal from the [ORG Treaty] will be seen in the West as an attempt to put pressure on a number of issues including in the economic sphere . Disagreements over energy security and a dispute over deliveries of [MISC Polish] meat have prevented [MISC Russian] and [ORG European Union] authorities from agreeing to a new mutual cooperation agreement . [PER Kagarlitsky] said that at some stage the [MISC Russian] government will put all of the economic issues on the table while expressing doubt whether the [MISC Russian] government 's goals will be achieved . 2007-07-14 [LOC Russian Federation] ( [MISC RU] ) International ; Government ; military [LOC Russia] withdraws from key post-cold war arms treaty limiting military deployment in [LOC Europe] .

[PER Joseph Wu] made his statement after [LOC China] made public the [MISC Chinese] draft budget bill for 2007 . [PER Joseph Wu] stated that [LOC China] is attempting to achieve global dominance because the significant budget increase , the lack of transparency in military buildup , the rapid expansion of air and naval forces , and progress in space defense technology suggests an attempt at global dominance . [PER Joseph Wu] stated that [LOC China] 's annual military spending has experienced double-digit growth since 1993 . [PER Joseph Wu] also stated that growth in [LOC China] 's military expenditure is not expected to slow down in the foreseeable future but will instead accelerate and become a long-term trend . [PER Joseph Wu] stated that [LOC China] 's continued military budget growth deserves global attention and concern because there is no apparent threat and no potential future threat to [LOC China] 's security in sight . [PER Joseph Wu] stated that [LOC China] 's threat to [LOC Taiwan] and other neighboring [MISC Asia-Pacific] countries is rising . [PER Joseph Wu] and [MISC Western] military experts stated that [LOC China] 's actual military budget is about 3 times the officially declared figure .

The test caused protests from the [LOC United States] and other nations . [ORG Foreign Ministry] spokesman [PER Liu Jianchao] said the [LOC United States] and other Governments have now been informed about the secret test through diplomatic channels . [PER Liu Jianchao] stated that the use of anti-satellite technology does not mean [LOC China] has abandoned its long-standing opposition to the military use of space . [PER Liu Jianchao] said at a ministry briefing that the test was not targeted against any country and does not pose a threat to any country . [PER Liu Jianchao] said that no plans for another such test by the secretive [MISC Chinese] military . The [MISC Chinese] test shot destroyed an overage weather satellite 537 miles above Earth and was detected by [LOC U.S.] monitors January 11 , 2007 . The [MISC Chinese] government refused to discuss it . The test raised concern in the [LOC United States] . Officials and analysts interpreted it as a signal that [LOC U.S.] military satellites could be vulnerable to attack by [LOC China] . [LOC China] 's ability to shoot down satellites could pose an added threat in the event of hostilities over [LOC Taiwan] because the [LOC U.S.] military relies on satellites for reconnaissance , navigation , weapons guidance systems and anti-missile defenses . [LOC China] 's newly demonstrated ability could threaten [MISC Taiwanese] satellites monitoring [MISC Chinese] short- and medium-range missile deployments along the [LOC Taiwan] Strait . [LOC U.S.] officials were dismayed by the [MISC Chinese] test because the [LOC United States] and [LOC Russia] have abstained from such tests after testing anti-satellite technology in the 1980s . This decision was partly because destroying satellites creates debris that could damage satellites in nearby orbits . [PER Liu] declined to address questions on this danger . Experts estimate that several hundred thousand debris fragments were created by the destruction of the satellite . The satellite orbited in a section of space where 125 other satellites fly . [LOC China] has started an accelerated military modernization program and has repeatedly stated its desire to be able to compete in 21st-century warfare . This includes the use of advanced electronics and information systems . The [MISC Chinese] military runs [LOC China] 's space program and has identified space-based communications and sensing systems as key to such efforts . Some [MISC Chinese] military theorists have advocated asymmetrical warfare . Pinpoint weapons would be used to disrupt the more advanced and better-equipped [LOC U.S.] military . Analysts believed that the January 11 , 2007 test was part of the military modernization program despite [LOC China] 's frequent declarations that it wants to prevent an arms race in space . [PER Liu] repeated the long-standing [MISC Chinese] position when asked about the appearance of a contradiction and said [LOC China] will further promote de-weaponization and the peaceful use of outer space . [LOC China] has consistently advocated at the [ORG United Nations] for the peaceful development of space and pushed for an international agreement to prevent it from becoming the theater for a new arms race . The [LOC United States] has opposed [LOC China] 's suggestion for an international conference to pursue such an accord and argued there is no need for it . [PER Liu] was asked whether the anti-satellite test violated the spirit of [LOC China] 's proclaimed position and why [LOC China] kept silent for nearly two weeks while officials around the world were discussing it on the basis of [LOC U.S.] intelligence reports . [PER Liu] said [LOC China] has nothing to hide . [LOC China] made the response about the test quickly after the relevant parties expressed their concerns .

An interior ministry spokesman told local newspapers that the arrested men had been involved in financing recruiters who sign up young [MISC Saudis] to go into turbulent areas . That is generally a reference to [LOC Iraq] . The spokesman said sizable amounts of cash had been found during searches of the men 's homes . Many young [MISC Saudi] radicals have crossed the long and porous border between the Kingdom and [LOC Iraq] and joined up with [MISC Sunni Muslim] insurgents there . [PER Alim] said that the government 's accusations were baseless and that his clients were well-known reformists with no connection to terrorism . [PER Alim] said the men might have been raising funds for [MISC Palestinian] or [MISC Iraqi] refugees . The men had been warned repeatedly by the government not to gather or write petitions because authorities feared the rise of a new political reform movement . [PER Alim] said the men do not want any kind of organized reform movement . The men are trying to stop any organized calls for reform . [PER Alim] said police had illegally searched the men 's homes without warrants and seized files , books and computers . This was after midnight on February 2 , 2002 . Neither [PER Alim] nor family members have been allowed to see the arrested men . [ORG Faleh] did not know why they were not allowed lawyers or charged publicly or shown proof or evidence if they are guilty of the crime . The arrests were the first to target democracy activists since reform-minded King [PER Abdullah] took the throne in 2005 and pardoned [ORG Faleh] and two other leading activists who had spent 18 months in prison . A dozen other men arrested with them in March 2004 signed statements pledging to stop lobbying for political freedoms . [ORG Faleh] and the two others refused to sign and demanded legal representation and a public trial . Legal Defense and public trials are allowed under [MISC Saudi] law but rarely applied . Most defendants go to court without attorneys . [LOC Saudi Arabia] is an absolute monarchy and has a consultative council appointed by the government .

[MISC Chinese] officials stated that the geostationary satellite will provide communications services over [LOC Africa] and parts of the [LOC Middle East] and [LOC Southern Europe] . The [MISC Chinese] officials also stated that the satellite will go into operation by the end of 2007 and is expected to last 15 years . The satellite will be managed from a control station in [LOC Abuja] , [LOC Nigeria] . This launch marks the first time [LOC China] has built a commercial satellite and put the satellite into orbit on contract for another country . The launch occurred on May 14 , 2007 before dawn near the [LOC Xichang] space center in southwestern [LOC Sichuan] province . Some view the launch as another sign of [LOC China] 's increasing skill in space technology and [LOC China] 's determination to be among the world 's great powers seeking to utilize the reaches of outer space for benefits on earth . [LOC China] 's space program 's rapid progress has caused worries in the [LOC United States] because the program is run by the military and [LOC China] has been recently emphasizing space-based information warfare . The concern intensified following the successful January 11 , 2007 test-firing of an anti-satellite missile . Some analysts stated that the test-firing demonstrated a risk to the many satellites on which [LOC United States] military forces rely for navigation and weapons guidance . [LOC China] 's space agency sent 2 astronauts into orbit in October 2005 in the [ORG Agency] 's second manned spaceflight .

The boy 's grandfather was [PER Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo] . [PER Gallardo] is the fugitive Founder of the [LOC Tijuana] drug cartel . June 4 , 2007 6 hooded gunmen entered the traditional all-night wake and shot two people , killing both . One newspaper called the gunmen commandos . The gunmen had written Z 's on the victims' backs before the left . The Z is a symbol of the [LOC Gulf] cartel . At least 46 more people were killed by the end of the week . There were multiple attacks including hand-grenade assaults and decapitations , with police , federal agents and rival drug-traffickers the principal victims . The killings show the scope of the violence and the tactics of psychological warfare behind it . The killings are dispersed across the country . Many deaths appear to involve disputes between competing bands of traffickers . At least one of those bands appears to be splitting into different groups . Authorities in [LOC Tuxtepec] on June 5 , 2007 found a severed head with a note . The note stated that this is going to happen to all the people who work with the zetas . It referred to the hit men who work for the [LOC Gulf] cartel . The message was signed as the new blood . [LOC Tuxtepec] is in the southeast side of [LOC Oaxaca] . The new blood refers to a group of [LOC Gulf] cartel operatives who have turned against the zetas as members of the organization bid to control trafficking routes and local drug markets . [LOC Mexico] 's Secretary of Public Safety [PER Genaro Garcia Luna] said in May 2007 that the [LOC Gulf] cartel had split into rival bands . [PER Garcia] [PER Luna] said in a recent press conference that the extreme violence in [LOC Mexico] was part of a strategy by drug traffickers to force authorities into a strategic retreat . [PER Garcia Luna] said that they are trying to create a climate of intimidation and fear in order to gain operational advantages . [PER Luna] said the residents of a rural town or urban neighborhood will refuse to cooperate with authorities and create a social space of support for traffickers if they believe that drug traffickers cannot be defeated . Gruesome killings have become frequent during the war this year . New incidents of violence have arisen every day this week . Authorities on June 6 , 2007 discovered a decapitated body left with a written message for State police in the port city of [LOC Veracruz] on the [LOC Gulf] of [LOC Mexico] . The message said police were protecting rival drug traffickers and that the decapitated man had been selling drugs for a rival group . Four other people were killed in and around [LOC Veracruz] that same day . This included a funeral Director who had transported the body of [PER Efrain Torres] to a cemetery in the city of [LOC Poza Rica] in May . [PER Torres] was an assassinated leader of the zetas . The body later was stolen from its crypt . Another victim of the violence in [LOC Veracruz] cannot yet be tallied among the dead . Business owner [PER Roberto] moguel [PER Martinez] was kidnapped by armed men on June 6 , 2007 after being released from a hospital . [PER Martinez] had been recovering from wounds suffered in a May 31 , 2007 attack . [PER Martinez] 's mother wrestled briefly with [PER Martinez] 's armed kidnappers on a street in the center of the city according to the [LOC Veracruz] newspaper notiver . [PER Martinez] has not been seen since . On June 7 , 2007 there were three grenade attacks on two police stations and an army barracks in the southern state of [LOC Guerrero] . Authorities said seven people were killed in apparent drug-related attacks there . The websites of [LOC Mexico City] newspapers on June 8 , 2007 reported as many as 20 people had been gunned down nationwide in drug-related violence the previous 24 hours . The dead included three people shot on a highway in the State of [ORG Durango] in northwest [LOC Mexico] . This happened on a week when President [PER Felipe Calderon] traveled to [LOC Europe] to meet with [PER Pope Benedict XVI] and other leaders . [PER Calderon] told reporters on June 4 , 2007 in [LOC Rome] that consumers in the [LOC United States] were to blame for the drug-driven chaos in [LOC Mexico] . [PER Calderon] said that this is a shared problem between the [LOC United States] and [LOC Mexico] . The principal cause is the use of drugs . And the [LOC U.S.] is the prime consumer in the world . [PER Calderon] has sent the army to numerous [MISC Mexican] states to fill in for over-matched and corrupt local police . 19 members of the army were ordered on June 4 , 2007 to be imprisoned as suspects in the killing of three women and two children at a rural anti-smuggling checkpoint in [LOC Sinaloa] . The five were members of a family returning from a wake . Military officials said they had failed to stop at the checkpoint . The shooting was more evidence of the war-like psychology gripping many corners of [LOC Mexico] . An estimated 1,200 people were already killed in the violence this year . 2007-08-21 [LOC Iran] ( [LOC Islamic Republic] of ) ( [ORG IR] ) International ; weapons ; politics ; proliferation ; energy The [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] reached an agreement with [MISC Iranian] officials that stated there were no remaining issues and ambiguities regarding [LOC Iran] 's nuclear program and activities . [LOC U.S.] and [MISC European] officials suspect that [LOC Iran] 's civilian nuclear energy program masks an effort to obtain technology that could be used in the production of an atomic bomb . [LOC U.S.] and [MISC European] officials suspect that [LOC Iran] 's civilian nuclear energy program masks an effort to obtain technology that could be used in the production of an atomic bomb . [LOC U.S.] and [MISC European] officials may impose a 4th round of sanctions on [LOC Tehran] when the [ORG U.N.] [ORG Security Council] considers the issue of [LOC Iran] 's nuclear energy program most likely in September 2007 . The [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] distributed limited copies of the [ORG IAEA] report before a meeting on 11 September 2007 of the 35 members of the [ORG IAEA] board . The findings reflect an agency agreement on 21 August 2007 with [LOC Tehran] that [MISC Iranian] officials began publicizing the week of 12 August 2007 . The accord said that there were no remaining issues and ambiguities regarding [LOC Iran] 's nuclear program and activities . According to an account by [ORG Reuters] news agency the [ORG IAEA] report said the work plan is a significant step forward . [ORG Reuters] quoted a senior [ORG U.N.] official as stating the [MISC Iranian] government 's efforts to enrich uranium had slowed . The [ORG IAEA] report stated that [MISC Iranian] officials must continue to build confidence about the scope and nature of [LOC Iran] 's present and future nuclear program . [MISC Iranian] officials on 30 August 2007 stated cooperation with the [ORG IAEA] possibly to prevent a further round of international sanctions . [LOC Iran] 's representative to the [ORG IAEA] [PER Ali Asghar] SOLTANIEH stated to [LOC Tehran] 's [LOC Fars] news agency that the report emphasized that there exists no sign or evidence indicating diversion of [LOC Iran] 's nuclear activities and that all of [LOC Iran] 's nuclear materials have been audited . Some [ORG Nonproliferation Experts] stated the [ORG IAEA] was ceding too much to [LOC Iran] . Arms-control experts [PER David Albright] and [PER Jacqueline Shire] of the [ORG Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security] wrote in a criticism published the week of 19 August 2007 that the idea of closing files violates fundamental safeguards principles and that the agreement does not specify that [MISC Iranian] officials would provide the [ORG IAEA] access to key people , facilities , and documents that are needed to verify [MISC Iranian] answers to the [ORG IAEA] 's questions . Independent experts stated [LOC Iran] 's latest agreement with the [ORG IAEA] which gives inspectors access to more nuclear sites and information falls short of the West 's demand to halt the production of concentrated uranium that could potentially be used for a bomb . [ORG U.S. State Department] spokesman for the [PER Bush] administration [PER Tom Casey] stated that while the report may offer some new details or insight into the development of [LOC Iran] 's program [MISC Iranian] officials have not met any international obligations regarding the nuclear program . [PER Casey] stated the fact that the nuclear program continues to move forward shows that the [MISC Iranian] regime is continuing on a path of defiance of the international community . Most [MISC Western Nonproliferation] Experts stated the Agreement on 21 August 2007 contained little that could dissuade policymakers in [LOC Washington] , [LOC London] , [LOC Paris] and [LOC Berlin] from moving forward with another round of [ORG Security Council] sanctions . Experts stated many of the transparency issues reportedly resolved in the Agreement on 21 August 2007 should have been resolved previously . Executive Director of nonpartisan [LOC Washington] think tank the [ORG Arms Control Association] [PER Daryl G. Kimball] stated the agreement does not address the problem that the [MISC Iranian] government is pursuing an enrichment technology and capability that could lead to the production of nuclear bomb material . [PER Kimball] stated the [MISC Iranian] government 's design is to deflect criticism and pressure and to claim that progress is being made . [MISC Iranian] officials stated a possible reduction in collaboration with inspectors in the event of more sanctions . The [ORG Security Council] has voted unanimously to impose sanctions against [LOC Iran] but the penalties have been limited from [LOC U.S.] demands under [MISC Chinese] and [MISC Russian] pressure . SOLTANIEH stated in an interview with state-controlled [MISC Iranian] television that the report and the measures taken make the intervention of any other international organization including the [ORG Security Council] irrelevant and unjustified . 2007-09-30 [LOC Israel] ( [LOC IL] ) proliferation ; technology ; international ; politics Documents outlining the [MISC Israeli] proposal to allow the international transfer of nuclear technology to [LOC States] that have not signed on to nonproliferation rules were distributed to the [MISC Nuclear Suppliers Group] . The proposal may complicate the [PER Bush] administration 's efforts to win an exemption for [LOC India] to engage in nuclear trade . [MISC Israeli] officials convinced a key group of nations engaged in nuclear trade to adopt new guidelines allowing the international transfer of nuclear technology to [LOC States] that have not signed on to nonproliferation rules . [LOC Countries] including [LOC India] , [LOC Israel] and [LOC Pakistan] that have not signed the nuclear [ORG Non-Proliferation Treaty] are prohibited from participating in international nuclear trade which includes purchasing reactors , uranium fuel or yellowcake . Documents outlining the [MISC Israeli] proposal were distributed to the 45-member [MISC Nuclear Suppliers Group] ( [ORG NSG] ) in March 2007 . The [MISC Israeli] presentation was made in a nonpaper that allows for official deniability . According to a letter from the Chairman of the [ORG NSG] on 17 March 2007 the [MISC Israeli] presentation was offered in the context of the [ORG NSG] 's debate over [MISC Indian] officials' bid for an exemption . Among the nations that have not signed the [LOC Treaty] only [LOC India] and [LOC Israel] would qualify for admission to the [ORG NSG] under the [MISC Israeli] proposal . The [MISC Israeli] plan offered 12 criteria for allowing nuclear trade with non-treaty states . 1 criterion indicated [LOC Israel] 's status as an undeclared nuclear weapons state and said a State should be allowed to engage in nuclear trade if the State applies stringent physical protection , control and accountancy measures to all nuclear weapons , nuclear facilities , source material and special nuclear material in the State 's territory . The documents circulated on [LOC Capitol Hill] in September 2007 as the [PER Bush] administration worked toward an agreement with [MISC Indian] officials . Executive Director of the [ORG Arms Control Association] in [LOC Washington] [PER Daryl Kimball] stated the [MISC Israeli] document could affect the debate over [LOC India] . [PER Kimball] stated -- The dynamics at the [ORG NSG] are that officials from the countries do not want to be obstacles to [LOC India] which is the largest country and the [LOC United States] which is the most powerful country . Consensus on [LOC India] will be difficult to reach when the [ORG NSG] meets in November 2007 . [LOC Israel] 's proposal gives officials from some countries reason to suggest an alternative approach to a specific exemption . [LOC Israel] 's record is good and better than [LOC India] 's in following international nuclear rules . Despite ties between [MISC Israeli] and [LOC U.S.] governments the [ORG Bush Administration] rejected the [MISC Israeli] proposal . The proposal may complicate the [PER Bush] administration 's efforts to win an exemption for [LOC India] to engage in nuclear trade . President [PER Bush] and Secretary of State [PER Condoleezza Rice] view the Pact as an important part of the [PER Bush] administration 's foreign policy legacy . The deal is controversial in [LOC India] and [ORG Congress] must give approval . Delays in winning approval for the [LOC India] deal could have a negative effect on the administration 's foreign policy legacy with delay until an election year having the most negative effect . [ORG State Department] spokesman [PER Tom Casey] stated the [LOC U.S.] government views the [LOC India] deal as unique and does not see the deal as a precedent for any other country including [LOC Israel] . Spokesman for the [MISC Israeli] embassy [PER David Siegel] stated the suggestion that the [MISC Israeli] government is demanding an exemption or linking efforts to any other issue including the [LOC India] debate is grossly inaccurate . [PER Seigel] stated -- The [MISC Israeli] government has never asked the [ORG NSG] for any exemption to nuclear supply guidelines or made any [MISC Israeli-specific] request of the [ORG NSG] . [LOC Israel] is recognized as a full-fledged adherent to the [ORG NSG Guidelines] . The [MISC Israeli] government has urged the [ORG NSG] to consider adopting a generic , multi-tiered , criteria-based approach towards nuclear technology transfers . Some officials from [ORG NSG] countries have previously suggested an approach like the [MISC Israeli] plan . If modification of the [ORG NSG Guidelines] were to take place along the lines proposed by [MISC Israeli] officials the nuclear nonproliferation regime would be considerably enhanced . 2007-06-18 [LOC Korea] , [ORG Democratic People 's Republic] of ( [ORG KP] ) proliferation ; international The [MISC North Korean] government may be prepared to begin shutting down a plutonium producing reactor in June 2007 as the first step toward disabling the Unit by December 2007 . Assistant Secretary of State [PER Christopher Hill] stated on 18 June 2007 that the [MISC North Korean] government may be prepared to begin shutting down a plutonium producing reactor in June 2007 as the first step toward disabling the Unit by December 2007 . [PER Hill] is the head [MISC American] negotiator on [LOC North Korea] 's nuclear weapons program . [PER Hill] stated stalled efforts to dismantle [LOC North Korea] 's nuclear weapons program could move ahead after the weekend of 16 June 2007 and 17 June 2007 when [LOC Pyongyang] officials invited inspectors from the [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] to visit for talks on verifying and monitoring a shutdown . Following talks with [MISC Chinese] negotiator [PER Wu Dawei Hill] stated the shutdown has long been anticipated . [PER Hill] stated the shutdown could occur in a matter of weeks not months . The [ORG Associated Press] reported from [LOC Vienna] , [LOC Austria] that the [ORG IAEA] stated on 18 June 2007 that a team would visit [LOC Pyongyang] the week of 24 June 2007 to discuss the manner in which inspectors will verify the shutdown . [PER Hill] stated [ORG IAEA] inspectors will hold talks with [LOC Pyongyang] officials on sealing the reactor which would include the installation of television monitors at the site . [MISC North Korean] officials refused to proceed with a February 2007 agreement to begin decommissioning the [LOC Yongbyon] reactor until funds worth 25 million dollars in accounts linked to [LOC North Korea] held in a [ORG Macao Bank] were transferred to [LOC North Korea] . The money was frozen when officials from the [LOC United States] accused the [ORG Banco Delta Asia] of complicity in financial crimes on behalf of [LOC North Korea] . The funds were wired on 14 June 2007 to the [LOC New York] [ORG Federal Reserve Bank] after months of disagreement over the method of returning the funds . The funds were to be sent to [LOC Russia] 's [ORG Central Bank] before a transfer to an account controlled by the [LOC North Korea] government in a [MISC Russian] commercial bank . [PER Hill] stated talks will occur the week of 17 June 2007 with disarmament negotiators from [LOC Russia] , [LOC South Korea] and [LOC Japan] on steps to recoup some of the time lost while the financial transfer was being organized . The discussions will also involve setting a timetable for resumption of 6-nation arms control talks . Under the agreement reached in February 2007 [MISC North Korean] officials pledged to shut down the [LOC Yongbyon] reactor and allow inspectors to verify and monitor the shutdown in return for a 50000-ton shipment of fuel oil . [MISC North Korean] officials will declare all nuclear programs and disable all facilities in return for a further 950000 tons of fuel oil in the next phase of the Agreement . [PER Hill] stated the technical possibility of concluding the next phase of the agreement by December 2007 . 2007-08-27 [LOC Iran] , [LOC Islamic Republic] of ( [ORG IR] ) International ; weapons ; proliferation ; Government ; energy Leading arms control experts criticize a new nuclear activities plan released by [LOC Iran] and the [ORG U.N] . 's [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] as ineffectual and dangerous . On 27 August 2007 [LOC Iran] and the [ORG U.N] . 's [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] released a plan for resolving issues by December 2007 . The issues have been unresolved for 4 years . The plan is meant to allay suspicions about [LOC Iran] 's past nuclear activities . Agency officials stated that the plan is a breakthrough . On 28 August 2007 at a news conference in [LOC Tehran] [MISC Iranian] President [PER Mahmoud ahmadinejad] stated that -- investigation into [LOC Iran] 's nuclear activities is now closed . No other member of the [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] has cooperated as well as [LOC Iran] . [LOC Iran] is a nuclear nation . [LOC Iran] has the nuclear fuel cycle . [LOC Iran] will not succumb to international pressure to curb [LOC Iran] 's nuclear projects . [LOC Iran] 's nuclear projects are for peaceful purposes . The [LOC United States] and some [MISC European] nations believe that [LOC Iran] 's nuclear projects are for the purpose of making nuclear weapons . Several [LOC Western Governments] and leading arms control experts stated that [LOC Iran] is attempting to avoid further punishment by the [ORG U.N. Security Council] . The [LOC Western Governments] include the [LOC United States] and [LOC France] . The Governments and experts believe that [LOC Iran] is attempting to -- slow the arms control process . avoid answering questions about [LOC Iran] 's past treaty violations . Physicist and President of the [ORG Institute for Science and International Security] [PER David Albright] stated that -- There is no way to verify [LOC Iran] 's claims . The [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] has no access to people , documents , sites . The [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] loses the right to ask further questions in the future . The unusual development sets a bad precedent . The [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] may have been tricked because it was eager for a deal . The [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] plan announced that -- [LOC Iran] resolved questions about [LOC Iran] 's past experiments with plutonium with no explanation how . Senior Fellow at the [ORG International Institute] for [MISC Strategic Studies] mark [PER Fitzpatrick] stated that -- The [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] plan is superficial . The [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] plan draws out negotiations for many months . The [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] plan could leave the [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] with incomplete and misleading answers from [LOC Iran] . The [ORG International Institute for Strategic Studies] is located in [LOC London] . Plutonium is a material that can be used to make nuclear weapons . The [ORG Institute for Science and International Security] is a private research organization located in [LOC Washington] . The [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] is based in [LOC Vienna] . 2007-11-15 [LOC Iran] ( [LOC Islamic Republic] of ) ( [ORG IR] ) proliferation ; international ; business A list from the [ORG Nuclear Suppliers Group] shows that [LOC Iran] has been denied purchases of nuclear-related materials approximately 75 times since 1998 because of suspicions the purchases could have been used for building bombs . A list from the [ORG Nuclear Suppliers Group] shows that [LOC Iran] has been denied purchases of nuclear-related materials approximately 75 times since 1998 because of suspicions the purchases could have been used for building bombs . The 45-nation [ORG Nuclear Suppliers Group] is an offshoot of the [ORG Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] and is charged with monitoring international trade to ensure that nuclear technology transferred for peaceful purposes is not directed to military use . The [ORG Nuclear Suppliers Group] is composed of technologically advanced countries . According to the [ORG Nuclear Suppliers Group] 's mission statement countries act on an individual basis to block trades that violate export controls devised to maintain international cooperation on peaceful uses of nuclear energy . The [ORG Nuclear Suppliers Group] has no enforcement power beyond notifying companies of violating the group 's guidelines . The [ORG Nuclear Suppliers Group] keeps data private and meets largely in secret . Most of the denials of purchase have occurred since 2002 and have resulted from interventions by members of the [ORG Nuclear Suppliers Group] . The list of trade denials was made available by a diplomat from a country interested in exposing the extent of [MISC Iranian] efforts to acquire so-called dual-use items that can be converted to weapons production . The list was made available on condition that neither the diplomat nor the diplomat 's country be identified . The list names companies from [LOC Australia] , [LOC Finland] , [LOC Sweden] , the [LOC United Arab Emirates] and [LOC Iran] that were prevented from carrying out deals because the items being sold were suspected of being militarily useful . The listed items being offered for sale in the blocked deals included Nickel powder , petrochemical plant components , compressors , furnaces , steel flanges and fittings , electron microscopes , radiometric ore-sorting machines , valves and tubing , lasers , a rotary drilling rig , a mass spectrometer and a nitrogen production plant . The [MISC Iranian] end users included the Government of [LOC Iran] and [LOC Iran] 's [ORG Atomic Energy Organization] , power companies , engineering , petrochemical and oil-refining and gas companies , aircraft industries , schools , universities , engine manufacturers , mineral research centers , a helicopter support company and a plasma physics center . The diplomat stated the 75 denials represented actions by only 7 of the 45 member States . The diplomat stated the actual number of denials of sales of dual-use products to [LOC Iran] is probably much higher than 75 . [MISC Western] diplomats stated that the government in [LOC Tehran] uses front companies to receive and convert technology to weapons production without being detected as the standoff with [LOC Iran] over [LOC Iran] 's nuclear program has continued . [LOC Iran] is a signatory to the [ORG Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] but not a member of the [ORG Nuclear Suppliers Group] .
