The [ORG Institute of Defence Studies] and analysis and the [ORG Institute for Strategic Studies] are 2 mutually-suspicious think tanks . [PER Shireen Mazari] stated at the accord signing ceremony in [LOC New Delhi] that the purpose of the accord is to build channels of communication at the level of scholars and that exchanges of security studies had been limited in the past because of the strained ties between [LOC India] and [LOC Pakistan] . [PER Shireen Mazari] is the director of [LOC Pakistan] 's [ORG Institute for Strategic Studies] . [PER Narendra] sisodia stated that the accord was a landmark because [LOC India] and [LOC Pakistan] have never had open discussions on security issues with the exception of contacts at international forums . [PER Narendra] sisodia is the Head of [LOC India] 's [ORG Institute of Defense] studies and analysis and a former [MISC Indian] Defence Secretary .

Drug production will be a main focus of a meeting in [LOC Tokyo] to assess progress in [LOC Afghanistan] . [ORG UN Office] on Drugs and Crime representative [PER Christina Oguz] stated that [LOC Afghanistan] has done little to stop the corruption enabling drug trade and [LOC Afghanistan] 's institutions are too weak to combat drug trade . [PER Oguz] stated to [ORG AFP] in an interview that the drug industry in [LOC Afghanistan] produces more than 90 percent of the world 's illegal opium and that ending the industry in [LOC Afghanistan] will take decades . Drug production escalated in 2007 and furthers deteriorating security . Drug production will be a main focus of ministers , donors and aid agencies meeting in [LOC Tokyo] on 5 February 2008 through 6 February 2008 to assess progress in [LOC Afghanistan] . A paper prepared for the talks said the expansion of the narcotics industry represents the single greatest threat to afghanistan????????s stability and is increasingly linked to insecurity and terrorist activities . The source of the document is the website of the joint coordination and monitoring board ( jcmb ) which is a committee working to implement [LOC Afghanistan] 's 5-year reconstruction plan . The paper said the drug trade funds terrorism , fuels corruption and undermines the rule of law that should bring security to the people of [LOC Afghanistan] . The paper said traffickers provide weapons , funding and personnel to anti-government rebels while corrupt officials offer protection of drug trade routes , poppy fields and people . 6 , [PER Oguz] stated a focus of the [LOC Tokyo] talks will be the need for immediate action in lieu of talking . [PER Oguz] stated -- The fact that President [PER Hamid Karzai] has not appointed a counternarcotics minister to replace the minister who resigned in July 2008 indicates the priority given to drug production even though [PER Karzai] has said drug production is 1 of the most important issues for [LOC Afghanistan] to tackle . Very little has been done to fight corruption . Corruption feeds the industry in that farmers often have to pay a 10 percent tax to [MISC Afghan] officials or [ORG Taliban] insurgents . Farmers must pay various bribes . Farmers receive less than 1/4 of the 4 billion dollars that annual trade earns which is equal to more than 1/2 of the legal gross domestic product . No one questions how people have very low salaries but drive in expensive cars and live in expensive houses . Typically only the couriers are arrested . [PER Oguz] stated bigger criminals are extremely difficult to find . Some are not living in [LOC Afghanistan] despite being [MISC Afghans] . [LOC Afghanistan] 's opium is increasingly converted into heroin inside [LOC Afghanistan] and supplies drug users in [LOC Europe] , [LOC Central Asia] and the [LOC Middle East] . [PER Oguz] stated blaming [LOC Afghanistan] for the world 's heroin problem would be unfair as heroin production is a shared responsibility . Chemicals needed to turn opium into heroin come primarily from the developed world and are illegally sent to [LOC Afghanistan] . [PER Oguz] stated the national strategy to deal with the drugs trade should be tailored to the different circumstances in the 34 provinces . 13 provinces were declared opium-free in 2007 which is double the figure from 2006 . [PER Oguz] stated -- The focus should be on interdiction in southern [LOC Afghanistan] because of the common interest between insurgents and drug traffickers to keep the south out of reach from the government in [LOC Kabul] and the international aid community . The north and center of [LOC Afghanistan] have more order and government structure and should be offered incentives like development to persuade farmers and other players to cease opium production . [PER Oguz] stated the necessity of a long-term effort to combat the drug problem with [LOC Afghanistan] rebuilding from below-scratch . [PER Oguz] stated the drug trade links into corruption and the insurgency and will not be an easy task to combat . [PER Oguz] stated combating the drug trade in [LOC Thailand] took 20 years even though [LOC Thailand] had some functioning institutions . 2008-02-12 [LOC Singapore] ( [ORG SG] ) terrorism ; money ; politics The Consortium for countering the financing of terrorism launched in [LOC Singapore] on 12 February 2008 and aims to inhibit militants' access to funds in [LOC Southeast Asia] .

[PER Gunaratna] stated the estimate was based on data gathered from the debriefing of captured militants , examination of documents seized from militant training camps and from intelligence reports . [PER Gunaratna] stated groups involved in the fund transfers include the [ORG Abu Sayyaf] and the [ORG Moro Islamic Liberation Front] which both operate in the southern [LOC Philippines] as well as the Southeast Asia-based [ORG JI] and groups in southern [LOC Thailand] and [LOC Indonesia] . Authorities blamed [ORG JI] for bombings which killed mostly foreigners among 202 people on the [MISC Indonesian] resort island of [LOC Bali] in 2002 and a series of other attacks . [PER Gunaratna] stated militant groups use the banking system , informal money transfers and couriers carrying bags filled with cash to transfer the funds . [PER Gunaratna] stated a portion of the money is raised in [LOC Southeast Asia] while some comes from the [LOC Middle East] and other countries . 2008-03-03 [LOC Iran] ( [ORG IR] ) proliferation ; international ; politics The [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] urges [LOC Iran] to clear up allegations of [LOC Iran] 's covert nuclear weapons program as the [ORG United Nations Security Council] imposed new sanctions against the government of [LOC Iran] .

[LOC US] envoy to the [ORG IAEA] [PER Gregory Schulte] stated to reporters prior to the meeting -- Despite limited progress in addressing past issues , troubling questions remain about [MISC Iranian] activities that strongly suggest a clandestine weapons-related program . The [ORG Board] is likely to support the [ORG Security Council] 's call for [LOC Iran] to suspend its enrichment-related activities Indications of weapons work constituting a violation of NPT obligations and [LOC Iran] 's violation of [ORG Security Council] resolutions provide strong reason for the [ORG Security Council] and the [ORG IAEA] to continue to investigate [LOC Iran] .

[PER Rasmussen] stated -- Politicians widely believed that [PER Saddam Hussein] kept WMD and other chemical and biological weapons . WMD were not the official reason for [LOC Denmark] entering the war in [LOC Iraq] . [LOC Denmark] entered the war in [LOC Iraq] because [PER Saddam] refused to cooperate with [ORG United Nations] . A majority of lawmakers in the [ORG Danish Parliament] approved military action .

[PER ElBaradei] said that even countries which have nuclear weapons know that a country which uses nuclear weapons will be pulverized but that extremist groups will use nuclear weapons if possible . [PER ElBaradei] said that countries need to be aware that extremist groups procuring nuclear weapons is the number one security threat the world is facing and added as a note of caution that given the state of the system of international controls it was hard to determine whether nuclear materials were ending up with extremist groups .

[LOC Colombia] stated on March 3 , 2008 that the country found computer documents suggesting the rebels have bought and sold uranium . [PER Francisco Santos] stated that the development demonstrates that the economic power of drug trafficking is enabling terrorist groups to constitute a serious threat not only to [LOC Colombia] but to the entire [MISC Andean] and [MISC Latin American] region . Uranium is a radioactive material which is the primary basis for generating dirty weapons of mass destruction and terrorism . [PER Francisco Santos] stated that the [MISC Colombian] Government was making strides to increase security inside the country and to combat terrorist access to weapons . [PER Francisco Santos] also stated that [LOC Colombia] has managed an unprecedented reduction in all levels of violence . 2008-03-06 [LOC Colombia] ( [LOC CO] ) proliferation ; politics [LOC Colombia] is worried about rebel plan involving obtaining uranium but has no evidence of plot for dirty bomb . The [MISC Colombian] government is worried about documents on the laptop of a slain rebel leader indicating the guerrillas were trying to obtain uranium . [MISC Colombian] Vice President [PER Francisco Santos] had told the 65-member [MISC Conference on Disarmament] on 080304 that the [MISC Colombian] Government was alarmed because uranium is the primary basis for generating dirty weapons of mass destruction and for terrorism . [PER Santos] backed off slightly and told the [ORG Associated Press] on 080305 that [MISC Colombian] authorities have no evidence or indication that the [ORG Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] are seeking to use the uranium to build a radioactive dirty bomb . [PER Santos] said in a telephone interview from [LOC Brussels] that what [PER Santos] had meant was to take note and not take it lightly and said that putting the [ORG FARC] rebels and the word uranium in the same sentence was alarming . The [ORG FBI] has an office in [LOC Bogota] and Spokesman [PER Richard kolko] said in [LOC Washington] that the [ORG FBI] has no information or intelligence regarding the [ORG FARC] attempting to use weapons of mass destruction . The [ORG FARC] has been fighting successive [MISC Colombian] Governments for more than 4 decades using conventional weapons . The document addressing uranium was found in a laptop belonging to a top [ORG FARC] commander named [PER Raul Reyes] . [PER Reyes] was killed on 080301 in a raid into [LOC Ecuador] that has generated intense international criticism . The poorly written communication addressed to [PER Reyes] was dated 080216 and was signed by [PER Edgar Tovar] . [PER Santos] said [PER Tovar] commands a [ORG FARC] front near [LOC Ecuador] . [PER Tovar] wrote that a man named [PER Belisario] in [LOC Bogota] supplies [PER Tovar] with explosives and sent [PER Tovar] a catalog and specifications . [PER Tovar] wrote that [PER Belisario] proposed to sell each kilo at [LOC US] $2.5 million and deliver it and that [PER Tovar] and [PER Reyes] would then find a buyer . [PER Tovar] wrote the deal would be with a Government and to sell them a sizable amount . [PER Tovar] wrote [PER Belisario] had 50 kilos ready and could sell a lot more as [PER Belisario] had direct contact with uranium suppliers . The uranium reference in [PER Tovar] 's writing was quickly cited by [LOC Colombia] 's government while seeking to deflect criticism over the raid . Gen. [PER Oscar Naranjo] said at an explosive news conference that the [ORG FARC] mentioning negotiations for 50 kilos of uranium means that the [ORG FARC] are taking big steps in the world of terrorism to become a global aggressor and were not just domestic guerrillas but transnational terrorists . [PER Santos] took [LOC Colombia] 's complaints to the [ORG European Union] 's foreign affairs representative [PER Javier Solano] on 080305 . [PER Santos] told the [ORG AP] after meeting with [PER Solano] that the [MISC Europeans] were really worried about the uranium and were not taking the issue lightly . [MISC Colombian] officials say they have no other information from the laptop or other sources indicating [ORG FARC] interest in radioactive materials or unconventional weapons . It wasn't clear what exactly the material [PER Tovar] was writing about might be . [PER Santos] said the uranium mentioned in the communication sounded like processed uranium . The price mentioned suggests that the uranium would be processed and hence dangerous . [PER Charles Ferguson] is a physicist with the [ORG Council on Foreign Relations] in [LOC Washington] and said that unprocessed uranium is relatively harmless and goes for about [LOC US] $100 a kilo . [PER Ferguson] expressed fear if the uranium in question were the highly enriched weapons-grade uranium capable of being used in a low-yield improvised nuclear device .

A parliamentary commission report stated on April 9 , 2008 that money from drug trafficking in [LOC Bulgaria] has been used to fund terrorist groups . The report said [MISC Bulgarian] crime groups engaged in trafficking and drugs sometimes work together with [MISC Arab] citizens linked to terrorist organizations . The [ORG Associated Press] obtained a copy of the document . The report said that part of the profit from trafficking in drugs such as amphetamines has been used to finance terrorist organizations like [ORG Hezbollah] , [LOC Islamic Jihad] , and [MISC Christian] militias in [LOC Lebanon] . The [ORG U.S. State Department] said in its 2008 international narcotics control strategy report that [LOC Bulgaria] continues to be a source of drug production . Part of that is being smuggled into [LOC Turkey] and the [LOC Middle East] . The parliamentary report was issued amid revelations of illegal links between senior police officers and criminals . The document said the amount of illegal drugs seized by authorities declined after classified police information had been leaked to criminals . The leaks prompted the arrest of senior police and a motion of no-confidence from opposition parties . The document is based on figures from the [ORG National Security Agency] . The motion will be voted on April 11 , 2008 . [LOC Bulgaria] 's government has been repeatedly criticized by the [ORG European Union] over its inability to tackle rampant corruption and organized crime .

The charges against members of the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood] included money laundering and terrorism . A security official stated that on 15 April 2008 an [MISC Egyptian] military court known for severe verdicts convicted 25 key members of the opposition [ORG Muslim Brotherhood] with sentences up to 10 years in jail . The security official attended the trial at the court north of [LOC Cairo] but spoke on condition of anonymity because the official is not authorized to speak to the media . The official stated the charges against members of [LOC Egypt] 's largest opposition group included money laundering and terrorism but it was not immediately clear if the 25 were found guilty of both offenses . The official stated that 15 other defendants were acquitted . Among the acquitted were businessman [PER Abdel-Rahman] [MISC Saudi] who runs a supermarket chain in [LOC Egypt] and a journalist . Authorities created a security ring around the courthouse with 100s of policemen creating checkpoints on the road leading to the court before the verdict announcement . Police searched vehicles and drove away reporters and family members of the defendants . A security official stated that approximately 20 people including relatives and reporters were detained . Defense lawyer [PER Abdel-Moneim Abdel-Maksoud] stated the judge entered the courtroom and issued the ruling but then left without notifying the opposition group 's defense lawyers who stood outside the courthouse after being prevented by policemen from entering the courtroom . The 25 sentenced included the Brotherhood 's chief strategist [PER Khayrat El-Shater] and the Brotherhood 's prominent financier and businessman [PER Hassan Malek] . [PER El-Shater] joined the Brotherhood in 1974 and has been jailed 4 times for a total of 7 years on charges relating to membership in the Brotherhood which was outlawed before 1958 . [PER Malek] owns a chain of furniture stores and textile factories and is known as 1 of the Brotherhood 's main financiers . [PER El-Shater] and [PER Malek] each received 7-year sentences . [PER El-Shater] and [PER Malek] 's property was confiscated and is believed to be worth millions of dollars . [PER Abdel-Maksoud] stated the confiscation will affect the Brotherhood 's financial bases . [PER Abdel-Maksoud] stated that a recent amendment to the [MISC Egyptian] judicial system allows defendants to appeal within 60 days . The 25 people sentenced have been in custody since December 2006 . The arrests were believed to have been sparked by a militia-style demonstration by student Brotherhood members from the [ORG Al-Azhar University in Cairo] . The demonstrators wore black and masks similar to those of the militant [MISC Palestinian] [ORG Hamas] and [LOC Lebanon] 's [ORG Hezbollah] groups . The demonstration prompted a government investigation into whether the Brotherhood had resurrected a military wing . The Brotherhood figures were referred to a military court after the arrests . The referral is authorized under emergency laws in effect since 1981 that allow the president to refer civilians to military tribunals . Brotherhood members have since been routinely tried before military courts but the trial in 2007-2008 is the largest in years . The verdict in the yearlong trial occurred amid a government crackdown on the Brotherhood and unrest in [LOC Egypt] over rising food prices and stagnant wages . More than 800 Brotherhood members have been detained in 2008 in an effort to decrease influence as President [PER Hosni Mubarak] enters the 27th year in power . 100s of Brotherhood members and supporters have been detained in Security sweeps since October 2006 . The 40 senior figures on trial were detained as part of the sweeps . 7 senior figures were tried in absentia and are believed to be outside the country .

Nada] whose company has been listed by the [LOC United States] since 2001 as an organization accused of helping fund terrorism . [MISC London-based] human rights group [ORG Amnesty International] called the sentences on 15 April 2008 a perversion of justice and demanded the men be released and retried in a civilian court . [ORG Amnesty International] said in a statement that the sentences leave little doubt that the [MISC Egyptian] authorities are determined to undermine what has become the main opposition group in [LOC Egypt] . [ORG Amnesty International] stated trying civilians before military courts flouts international standards of fair trial and is inherently unjust . The [ORG Muslim Brotherhood] 's supreme leader [PER Mohammed Mahdi Akef] denounced the verdict and stated that [MISC Egyptian] authorities are corrupt gangsters . [PER Akef] stated to the [ORG Associated Press] that there was no evidence against the convicted and that acquittals for the convicted are expected . [PER Akef] stated in a telephone interview that gangs not politicians rule [LOC Egypt] . [PER Akef] would not discuss the Brotherhood 's future plans .

On 17 April 2008 a [MISC South African] government spokesman stated that [LOC South Africa] will not intervene to stop a shipment of Chinese-made weapons from reaching [LOC Zimbabwe] despite the acute instability of the political situation in [LOC Zimbabwe] . [MISC South African] government spokesman [PER Themba Maseko] stated that the [MISC Zimbabwean] government 's failure to release election results 2 weeks after elections is cause for great concern and that the dire situation requires mediation . [PER Maseko] 's comments were the strongest issued on the subject by the [MISC South African] Government to date . [MISC South African] President [PER Thabo Mbeki] is the main mediator in [LOC Zimbabwe] . [PER Mbeki] has stated that there is no crisis in [LOC Zimbabwe] despite the increasing violence and intimidation since the 29 March 2008 vote and the refusal of [LOC Zimbabwe] 's election commission to release results that independent observers and the opposition State show President [PER Robert Mugabe] lost the vote . Critics call the [MISC South African] reaction appeasement . Criticism increased on 17 April 2008 following a report that [MISC South African] mediator [PER Sydney Mufamadi] led an arms control committee meeting that approved transit of a shipment of [MISC Chinese] weapons across [MISC South African] territory en route to [LOC Zimbabwe] . The [MISC Chinese] ship called an [PER Yue Jiang] docked in [LOC Durban] harbor in [LOC South Africa] after receiving approval from Port authorities late on 16 April 2008 . The [ORG Beeld] newspaper stated the ship was carrying approximately 3 million rounds of ammunition for small arms and [MISC AK-47s] , approximately 3500 mortars and mortar launchers and 1500 rockets for rocket-propelled grenades . The newspaper stated it obtained a copy of the ship 's cargo documentation finalized 3 days after [LOC Zimbabwe] 's election on 01 April 2008 . A [MISC South African] government official speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed the presence of weapons on the ship but gave no further details . [LOC Durban] port authorities and police explosives inspectors could not immediately be reached for comment . Government spokesman [PER Maseko] stated that if administrative papers are in order the Government of [LOC South Africa] cannot intervene to prevent weapons from being transported through its territory to a neighboring landlocked country . After a cabinet meeting [PER Maseko] stated to reporters -- The Government of [LOC South Africa] cannot act unilaterally to prevent a trade deal between 2 countries . [LOC South Africa] is not involved in the arrangement . It would be possible but very difficult for [LOC South Africa] to intervene and to disallow the shipment . There was presently no trade embargo against [LOC Zimbabwe] . [LOC China] is one of [LOC Zimbabwe] 's main trade partners and allies . A group representing mainly white [MISC South Africans] called afriforum stated it would organize protests along the route to [LOC Zimbabwe] . [PER Afriforum] 's kallie kriel stated that the [MISC National Conventional Arms Control Committee] had granted approval for the transit of the weapons on 14 April 2008 . [PER Kriel] stated he had written to [ORG Committee] Chairman and Local Government Minister [PER Sydney Mufamadi] asking him to retract the permission . [PER Kriel] stated that the [MISC South African] Government 's approval for the transport of the arms across [MISC South African] territory effectively means that the government is replacing its ineffective policy of silent diplomacy with a more catastrophic policy of complicity with the State violence and human rights violations committed by the [MISC Zimbabwean] government against its own citizens . The [MISC South African] opposition [ORG Democratic Alliance] agreed with kriel 's comments . [PER Mufamadi] also heads the [MISC South African] mediating team between [LOC Zimbabwe] 's ruling [ORG ZANU-PF] party and the opposition Movement for [MISC Democratic Change] . [PER Mufamadi] 's office referred reporters to the [MISC Arms Control Committee] whose spokesman did not immediately return phone calls . 2008-04-17 [LOC South Africa] ( ZA ) ; [LOC Zimbabwe] ( ZW ) International ; weapons ; proliferation ; Government ; politics The [MISC South African] Government stated on April 4 , 2008 that the [MISC South African] Government will probably not stop the arms shipment head to [LOC Zimbabwe] . This decision is controversial because [LOC Zimbabwe] is currently politically unstable . A [MISC South African] government spokesman stated on April 4 , 2008 that [LOC South Africa] will not intervene to stop a shipment of Chinese-made weapons from reaching [LOC Zimbabwe] even though the political situation in [LOC Zimbabwe] is dire . The shipment is in a ship called the an [PER Yue] hiang which was anchored outside [LOC Durban] harbor after receiving permission late on April 16 , 2008 to dock . The shipment contains nearly 3 million rounds of ammunition for small arms and [MISC AK-47s] , about 3500 mortars and mortar launchers and 1500 rockets for rocket-propelled grenades . This report comes from the [ORG Beeld] newspaper which claimed to have a copy of the ship 's cargo documentation finalized on April 1 , 2008 which was 3 days after [LOC Zimbabwe] 's election . An anonymous government official confirmed that the shipment contained weapons but gave no further details . [LOC Durban] port authorities and police explosives inspectors could not be reached for comment . The [MISC South African] Revenue Service said customs officials were bound by confidentiality rules and could not give details of the content of the cargo . Spokesman [PER Themba Maseko] stated as long as administrative papers are in order [LOC South Africa] cannot intervene to prevent weapons being transported through [MISC South African] territory to [LOC Zimbabwe] . Defense Secretary January [PER Masilela] confirmed to [MISC South African] radio that the [MISC National Conventional Arms] [ORG Control Committee] granted approval for the transit of the weapons . January [PER Masilela] stated that if the buyer is the [MISC Zimbabwean] sovereign government and the seller is the [MISC Chinese] sovereign government , [LOC South Africa] has nothing to do with the transaction because [LOC South Africa] works according to established international conventions which allow the nation no jurisdiction over goods in transit . [PER Sydney Mufamadi] is the government official who approved the transit and he is the same official who heads the team mediating in the [LOC Zimbabwe] crisis . [PER Themba Maseko] stated that the situation in [LOC Zimbabwe] is dire because elections are held and results are not released 2 weeks after . This was the strongest comment on [LOC Zimbabwe] so far by the [MISC South African] Government . On April 17 , 2008 [MISC Zimbabwean] opposition leader [PER Morgan Tsvangirai] called on [LOC South Africa] and President [PER Thabo Mbeki] to step aside as mediator for [LOC Zimbabwe] in favor of [LOC Zambia] 's president , who has taken a tougher stance toward [PER Mugabe] .

[PER Afriforum] stated that the group would organize protests along the route to [LOC Zimbabwe] . [PER Kallie] kriel of afriforum stated that the [MISC South African] Government 's approval for the transport of the arms across [MISC South African] territory will in effect mean that the Government is replacing an ineffective policy of silent diplomacy with an even more catastrophic policy of complicity to the State violence and human rights violations committed by the [MISC Zimbabwean] government against [MISC Zimbabwean] citizens . The [MISC South African] Revenue Service stated that the ship would be subject to standard inspection procedures and the cargo would not be released until ithe cargo was proved to be compliant to customs formalities .

On 080425 the [ORG United Nations Security Council] unanimously approved a resolution urging increased efforts to keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of terrorists and black marketeers . The [ORG Security Council] resolution calls on all States to fully implement a [ORG Security Council] resolution adopted in 040400 requiring all 192 [ORG United Nation] Member States to adopt laws to prevent non-State actors from acquiring nuclear , chemical or biological weapons . The [ORG Security Council] resolution notes that some unnamed countries have not filed a report on the member nations efforts to adopt these laws . The report was due to the [ORG United Nations] in 041000 . The 080425 [ORG Security Council] resolution stresses the need to enhance the coordination of national , regional and international efforts to strengthen a global response to the serious challenge of keeping weapons from terrorists and the threat to international security . The 040400 [ORG Security Council] resolution was adopted to close a loophole in global efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . International treaties targeted weapons proliferation by Governments until Resolution 1540 was adopted in 040000 there was no legal instrument to prevent terrorists , criminal scientists , black marketeers and other non-State actors from obtaining weapons of mass destruction . Resolution 1540 was introduced as the [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] was investigating a vast black market in nuclear equipment and technology . The black market investigation was encouraged by [LOC Pakistan] 's admission in 040200 that [LOC Pakistan] 's leading nuclear scientist had passed technology to [LOC Iran] , [LOC Libya] and [LOC North Korea] . [LOC Pakistan] 's leading nuclear scientist , was [PER Abdul Qadeer Khan] . Resolution 1540 requires all countries to adopt laws to prevent non-State actors from manufacturing , acquiring or trafficking in nuclear , biological or chemical weapons , the materials to make them , and the missiles and other systems to deliver them . Resolution 1540 requires all countries to take measures to account for and secure these weapons , missiles and other weapons material . Resolution 1540 also demands that countries develop border controls and step up law enforcement efforts to detect , deter , prevent and combat the illicit trafficking and brokering of weapons of mass destruction . All countries were required to submit a report within 6 months to a [ORG Security Council] committee monitoring implementation of esolution 1540 . The resolution adopted on 080425 extends the Resolution 1540 [ORG Committee] 's mandate until 110425 and again calls upon all States that have not yet presented a first report on steps the States have taken or intend to take to implement Resolution 1540 to submit such a report to the 1540 [ORG Committee] without delay . The 080425 resolution emphasizes the importance for all States to fully implement Resolution 1540 . The 080425 resolution also calls on the Resolution 1540 [ORG Committee] to continue to intensify its efforts to promote the full implementation by all States by reaching out to countries , facilitating technical assistance , and promoting shared experience and lessons learned . The [ORG Security Council] stated that not all States have presented to the Resolution 1540 [ORG Committee] the state 's national reports on implementation of Resolution 1540 and that the full implementation of Resolution 1540 by all States is a long-term task that will require continuous efforts at national , regional and international levels . The [ORG Security Council] stated that full implementation of Resolution 1540 by all States includes the adoption of national laws and measures to ensure implementation of the Resolution 1540 inspired national laws . [PER Dumisani Kumalo] stated that many developing countries find the reporting requirements for Resolution 1540 and other resolutions onerous when they are trying to provide food , health care and jobs for the people of developing countries . [PER Dumisani Kumalo] is the current [ORG Security Council] president and [LOC South Africa] 's [ORG United Nations] ambassador . [PER Dumisani Kumalo] stated that one of the things that [LOC South Africa] is happy about is that countries must cooperate in dealing with the networks that may be spreading illict nuclear and other weapons . The 080425 resolution was approved on the day that [PER Mohamed ElBaradei] angrily criticized [LOC Israel] for bombing an alleged [MISC Syrian] nuclear facility , chastised the [LOC United States] for withholding information on the alleged [MISC Syrian] nuclear facility , and stated that the [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] would investigate the allegations of the [MISC Syrian] nuclear facility .

The expert praised [LOC Beijing] officials for decreasing sales of weapons abroad . A leading arms expert stated on 8 May 2008 that [MISC Chinese] government is making dramatic improvements to [LOC China] 's nuclear arsenal which raises questions for future arms control efforts . Director of the [ORG Stockholm International Peace Research Institute] [PER Bates Gill] spoke at a panel for journalists while on a visit to [LOC Beijing] to promote an annual report on the global arms industry . [PER Gill] stated -- Recent upgrades have increased the accuracy and mobility of [LOC China] 's arsenal while a switch from liquid to solid fuel has shortened reaction times . [LOC China] stands out due to the effort to modernize , expand and improve nuclear weapons capability . Among the 5 nuclear [ORG Powers] [LOC China] is making the most dramatic improvements in nuclear force which raises arms control questions . The [MISC Chinese] Government stated [LOC China] will never be the first to use nuclear weapons in a conflict and [LOC China] 's arsenal , estimated at just over 100 nuclear-armed missiles , is the smallest of the 5 main nuclear weapon [ORG Powers] . [MISC Chinese] officials signed the [MISC Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] in 1992 and gill stated the recent steps are aimed mainly at reducing the vulnerability of [LOC China] 's deterrent force . [PER Gill] stated that improvements in [LOC China] 's conventional military are even more dramatic after more than 10 years of double-digit percentage increases in annual defense spending . [PER Gill] stated the large increase in the military capability of [LOC China] is targeted mostly at [LOC Taiwan] but has the possibility going forward with force projection elsewhere . [LOC Taiwan] is a self-governing island that [LOC China] claims is part of [LOC China] 's territory and has threatened to invade . [PER Gill] stated that the increase in military capability complicates the issue of [LOC China] as a player in the arms control agenda and that the [MISC Chinese] government would need to be engaged in future efforts to cap or reduce numbers of nuclear weapons . [PER Gill] praised [LOC Beijing] officials for decreasing sales of weapons and military technology abroad which [PER Gill] believes was largely done out of a desire to be viewed as a more responsible player in international society . According to the [ORG Stockholm International Peace Research Institute] [LOC China] has only a 2 percent share of the global arms export trade . [PER Gill] stated that the shift in the way the [MISC Chinese] government views the problem of nonproliferation is very positive . [PER Gill] stated that authorities need to strengthen regulation to prevent weapons from entering conflict zones , particularly in [LOC Africa] where [MISC Chinese] arms are used by both government and rebel forces in [LOC Sudan] 's [LOC Darfur] region . Retired People 's [ORG Liberation Army] Colonel [PER Teng] jianqun spoke alongside [PER Gill] on the panel and stated that [LOC China] has substantial restrictions on weapons sales abroad . [PER Teng] conceded that some dealers violated the rules and were beyond the Government 's direct control . [PER Teng] stated that further steps were being taken to boost awareness of the rules , partly through courses for government and defense industry leaders run by the foreign ministry-sponsored [ORG China Arms Control and Disarmament Association of] which [PER Teng] is Deputy Secretary-General .

The legislation is the most recent effort by [LOC Japan] to ascribe more freedom to its tightly controlled military and would overturn a ban on the military use of space . On 13 May 2008 [LOC Japan] 's powerful lower house of parliament voted to allow [LOC Japan] 's space programs to be utilized for national defense . The legislation is the most recent effort by [LOC Japan] to ascribe more freedom to the tightly controlled military technically known as a self-defense force . The legislation is expected to be approved by the upper house . The legislation is primarily aimed at permitting military use of [LOC Japan] 's civilian-controlled spy satellite network for defense as defined by the pacifist constitution . The bill states that space development has become increasingly important . The bill states that space programs must contribute to ensure peace and safety of international society as well as the national security of [LOC Japan] . The bill does not specify how the programs will be utilized but the satellite network and other assets could potentially be used for surveillance , planning and for a missile defense shield [LOC Japan] is constructing with the [LOC United States] . The bill would overturn a ban on the military use of space imposed on [LOC Japan] 's nascent space program in 1969 . The [MISC U.S.-drafted] 1947 [LOC Constitution] prohibits [LOC Japan] from offensive warfare . The legislation stipulates that all members of the cabinet and not just education , science and technology ministers will be responsible for [LOC Japan] 's future space projects . Inclusion of the defense minister in decisions on space programs introduces the possibility for the military to possess and develop spy satellites . The legislation would establish a special space task force led by the [ORG Prime Minister] and create the new post of space development minister . [LOC Japan] 's [ORG Defense Agency] was upgraded to Ministry status in 2007 . [MISC Japanese] troops were dispatched to a combat zone for the first time since [MISC World War II] in 2004 . The mission in [LOC Iraq] was strictly humanitarian . Support . Both the ruling coalition and the largest opposition party support the bill . The nation 's largest newspaper [ORG Yomiuri] approved of the bill and urged its quick enactment . In a weekend editorial the newspaper [ORG Yomiuri] stated that it is logical to use space development for national security and necessary to counter the threat of [LOC North Korea] 's missile program . Opposition . Some pacifist lawmakers from the [MISC Communist] and Social Democratic parties boycotted the vote on 13 May 2008 stating that the bill contradicted the principle of a civilian-controlled space program . The left-leaning newspaper [ORG Asahi] raised concerns that the legislation could escalate friction with neighboring countries . 2008-05-14 [LOC Estonia] ( EE ) ; [LOC Latvia] ( LV ) ; [LOC Lithuania] ( LT ) ; [LOC Germany] ( [LOC DE] ) ; [LOC Italy] ( IT ) ; [LOC Spain] ( ES ) ; [LOC Slovakia] ( [LOC SK] ) ; [LOC Russian Federation] ( [MISC RU] ) ; [LOC United States] ( [LOC US] ) International ; Government ; Telecom ; technology ; science 7 [ORG NATO] allies to sign agreement to create a cyber [ORG Defense Research Center] in [LOC Estonia] .

The attacks occurred after a dispute between the Governments of [LOC Russia] and [LOC Estonia] over the relocation of a [MISC Soviet] war memorial . Many [MISC Estonians] suspect the [MISC Russian] government was responsible for the cyber attacks but the Government of [LOC Russia] denies involvement . Defense chiefs from [LOC Estonia] , [LOC Latvia] , [LOC Lithuania] , [LOC Germany] , [LOC Italy] , [LOC Spain] and [LOC Slovakia] will sign the agreement to provide staff and funding for the center . The [LOC United States] will join the project as an observer and other [ORG NATO] nations may join later . Signing of the Agreement is a peripheral issue of the meeting of Chiefs of [ORG Defense Staff] from the 26 ally countries of [ORG NATO] . The meeting is expected to focus on [ORG NATO] missions in [LOC Afghanistan] and [LOC Kosovo] . The generals will also discuss cooperation with [MISC Balkan] and former [MISC Soviet] nations including [LOC Russia] and [LOC Ukraine] . The Cyber [ORG Defense Center] will be operational in August 2008 with the formal opening planned for 2009 . A staff of 30 specialists will conduct research and training on cyber warfare and will be prepared to assist [ORG NATO] members with response to any future cyber attacks . Head of the center major [PER Raul] rikk stated to the [ORG Associated Press] in [LOC Tallinn] -- The attacks against [LOC Estonia] last year were cyber terrorism .

[LOC Afghanistan] is 1 of the world 's major opium producers and supplies [MISC Western] markets through transit countries such as [LOC Russia] . On 15 May 2008 the Government of [LOC Russia] proposed cooperation with [LOC India] and [LOC China] to increase security around [LOC Afghanistan] in order to block drug supplies . [MISC Russian] Foreign Minister [PER Sergey Lavrov] at a joint news conference in [LOC Yekaterinburg] with the foreign ministers of [LOC India] and [LOC China] stated that tightening security at [MISC Afghan] borders would decrease the threat of drugs and terrorism . [PER Lavrov] 's intentions were not immediately clear since neither [LOC Russia] nor [LOC India] has a border with [LOC Afghanistan] and [LOC China] 's border with [LOC Afghanistan] is only 76 kilometers ( 45 miles ) . [LOC Afghanistan] 's other neighbors are [LOC Iran] , [LOC Turkmenistan] , [LOC Uzbekistan] , [LOC Tajikistan] and [LOC Pakistan] . [LOC Afghanistan] is 1 of the world 's major opium producers and supplies [MISC Western] markets through transit countries such as [LOC Russia] . The Government of [LOC Russia] states that thousands of [MISC Russians] die from AIDS-related illnesses each year due to abuse of [MISC Afghan-sourced] heroin with infected needles . Officials in [LOC Afghanistan] 's neighboring countries regularly announce large-scale arrests and seizures of narcotics made after illegal convoys cross the border . Last week drug police in [LOC Tajikistan] announced their interception of the largest quantity of opium and heroin in [LOC Tajikistan] 's history estimated to be worth approximately 10 million [LOC U.S.] dollars ( 6.5 million euro ) . 2008-05-15 [LOC Russian Federation] ( [MISC RU] ) Weapons ; military ; proliferation [LOC Russian Federation] President [PER Dmitry Medvedev] promised on May 15 , 2008 to provide funding for [LOC Russia] 's nuclear missile program .

[PER Dmitry Medvedev] examined Topol-M intercontinental ballistic missiles concealed by the military in a dense pine forest and spoke to officers at the base in teikovo . [PER Dmitry Medvedev] was impressed by the weapons and the level of training . [PER Dmitry Medvedev] also stated that it is good that the military is getting new missiles like the Topol-M . Missiles from the base in teikovo took part in the [MISC Victory Day] parade on May 9 , 2008 when [LOC Russia] displayed the country 's military hardware on [LOC Red Square] in [LOC Moscow] for the first time since the [MISC Soviet] collapse . [PER Dmitry Medvedev] experienced motivation while watching the missiles across the square and promised that such parades will continue and may be expanded in the future . [PER Dmitry Medvedev] stated that the [LOC Russian Federation] 's task for the next few years is to make sure that the [ORG Strategic Missile Forces] receive the necessary funding to respond to modern threats . [PER Dmitry Medvedev] also stated that certain progress has been made recently and that the speed of progress must not be lost . [PER Dmitry Medvedev] promised to raise officers' salaries . [PER Dmitry Medvedev] was sworn in on May 7 , 2008 as the [LOC Russian Federation] 's President and has so far portrayed an image of a liberal and avoided the harsh anti-western rhetoric of [PER Vladimir Putin] . [PER Vladimir Putin] was [PER Dmitry Medvedev] 's predecessor and mentor . Most observers expect [PER Dmitry Medvedev] to continue the policies of [PER Vladimir Putin] , such as an assertive posture on the international scene and vow to strengthen the military . Teikovo is a small town in the [LOC Ivanovo] region about 250 kilometers or 155 miles northeast of [LOC Moscow] . [PER Vladimir Putin] fiercely opposed the [ORG United States'] plans to deploy missile defense sites in [LOC Poland] and the [LOC Czech Republic] , and [ORG NATO] 's plans to accept into the alliance [LOC Russia] 's ex-Soviet neighbors , [LOC Ukraine] and [LOC Georgia] . [PER Vladimir Putin] has threatened to point nuclear missiles at countries that take part in [LOC U.S.] missile defense and opted out of a key [MISC Soviet-era] arms control treaty . Topol-M missiles are capable of hitting targets more than 10000 kilometers or 6000 miles away . The missiles are deployed in both silo-based and truck-mounted versions . Strategic missiles forces chief General [PER Nikolai Solovtsov] stated that the Topol-M is a new step in missile design . [PER Vladimir Putin] and other officials have boasted about the Topol-M 's ability to penetrate any prospective missile defense . [PER Yuri] solomonov designed the missile and stated that the missile drops engines at a significantly lower altitude than earlier designs which makes it hard for an enemy 's early warning system to detect the launch . [PER Yuri] solomonov stated that the missiles' warhead and decoys closely resemble one another in flight , making it very difficult for a foe to select the real target from a multitude of false ones . Deployment of topol=ms has proceeded slowly . Large oil revenues in recent years have allowed the Government of the [LOC Russia] Federation to buy weapons and fund the development of new missiles . Soviet-built ballistic missiles have remained the backbone of the nation 's nuclear forces . The Navy of the [LOC Russian Federation] is in poor shape . Soviet-built nuclear submarines frequently need repairs and rarely leave the bases . The [PER Yuri] dolgoruky is the first in a series of new nuclear submarines to be commissioned this year but the bulava nuclear-armed missile developed to equip the submarine has failed tests and the deployment prospects are uncertain . 2008-07-10 [LOC Iran] ( [ORG IR] ) International ; weapons Expert states that [MISC Iranian] missile launch photo was doctored to show failed 4th missile launching . 20080710 director of the [ORG London-based International Institute] for [ORG Strategic Studies] 's non-proliferation program and former [ORG US State Department] official [PER Mark Fitzpatrick] stated that an [MISC Iranian] photograph showing a cluster of missile launches from a desert range was altered to add a 4th missile . The image was posted 20080709 on the Sepah news site , which is run by [LOC Iran] 's [ORG Revolutionary Guards] . 20080710 the image was replaced with an image of the same 3 missiles in the previous photo but in place of the 4th missile is a grounded missile and what appears to be a vehicle nearby . 20080710 the image with 4 launches was absent from Sepah 's main page but both images were in the archive . [PER Fitzpatrick] stated that the photo was probably manipulated to obscure the failure of the 4th missile in order to maintain the impact of [LOC Iran] 's demonstration of power . [MISC Iranian] officials did not immediately comment on the photos . The image was described as depicting part of military maneuvers in which nine missiles were test fired , including an enhanced version of the [MISC Shahab-3] . [MISC Iranian] officials stated that the enhanced [MISC Shahab-3] missile has a range of 1250 miles and thus could reach [LOC Israel] and the majority of the [LOC Middle East] . The [LOC US] government immediately criticized the missile test . 2008-07-13 [LOC Israel] ( [LOC IL] ) ; [LOC Syrian] [LOC Arab Republic] ( SY ) ; [LOC Iran] ( [ORG IR] ) ; [LOC United States] ( [LOC US] ) International ; weapons ; proliferation ; politics More than 40 nations , including [LOC Israel] and [LOC Arab States] , agreed Sunday to work for a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the [LOC Middle East] .

[LOC Israel] is widely believed to have a stockpile of nuclear weapons . The Government of [LOC Israel] 's official stated policy neither confirms nor denies if [LOC Israel] possesses nuclear bombs . [LOC Israel] 's official stated nuclear weapons policy is called nuclear ambiguity . The question of nuclear weapons in the [LOC Middle East] region is particularly sensitive lately due to tensions between [LOC Israel] and [LOC Iran] .

The [ORG U.N.] stated on 28 July 2008 that the international community should do more to stop chemicals used to convert opium to heroin from reaching [LOC Afghanistan] and detailed increasing sophistication in [LOC Afghanistan] 's drug trade . [LOC Afghanistan] produces more than 90 percent of the world 's opium . Opium production in [LOC Afghanistan] has increased since the [MISC U.S.-led] invasion removed the [ORG Taliban] regime in 2001 . Officials in the [MISC American-backed] government and [ORG Taliban] militants are believed to profit from the illicit trade . [ORG U.N.] figures show [LOC Afghanistan] yielded approximately 9000 tons of opium in 2007 which could create more than 900 tons of heroin . [LOC Afghanistan] 's representative for the [ORG U.N.] Office on Drugs and Crime [PER Christina Oguz] stated the conversion of opium resin into heroin is increasingly being done inside [LOC Afghanistan] mostly at laboratories in the border regions in the insurgency-plagued [LOC South] and the [MISC East] . [PER Oguz] stated to reporters in [LOC Kabul] that evidence of higher quality [MISC Afghan] heroin indicates that the people running the labs are getting assistance from chemists who have come from outside the country as foreign consultants . [PER Oguz] stated the chemists originated from countries near the border but did not detail specific countries . [PER Oguz] stated the chemicals needed to make the heroin were being smuggled from [LOC China] , [LOC South Korea] , [MISC European] countries , including [LOC Russia] , and other parts of the world . [PER Oguz] stated the so-called precursor chemicals such as acetic anhydride also have legal uses including in the paint and pharmaceutical industries . [PER Oguz] stated the chemicals often are legally exported but later diverted to [LOC Afghanistan] for illicit goals and [LOC Afghanistan] has no major legal industries that would require such chemicals . [PER Oguz] stated -- Blaming [LOC Afghanistan] alone for the heroin problem in the world is not correct . [LOC Afghanistan] does produce the opium which is the raw material for heroin but it is not possible to make heroin without certain chemicals that are not produced inside [LOC Afghanistan] and are smuggled into [LOC Afghanistan] . More than 200 tons of the chemicals have been seized by [MISC Afghan] authorities since 2006 but some 13000 tons were needed based on 2007 's opium production figures . The figures suggest the confiscated amount represented a small fraction of the total smuggled in . Most seizures of the chemicals occur along the eastern border with [LOC Pakistan] but a good deal comes via the western border with [LOC Iran] . [PER Oguz] stated the international community should share more information on known smugglers of the chemicals who were long-established and based in [LOC Afghanistan] 's neighboring countries . [MISC Western] officials are increasingly concerned that [ORG Taliban] militants are bankrolling the insurgency through the drug trade . The [ORG U.N.] briefing comes in the wake of allegations that [MISC Afghan] President [PER Hamid Karzai] protected drug lords for political reasons . A former senior [ORG U.S. State Department] counter-narcotics official wrote in an article in the 27 July 2008 issue of [ORG New York Times] magazine that narco-corruption went to the top of the [MISC Afghan] Government . The official alleged [PER Karzai] was reluctant to move against big drug lords in [PER Karzai] 's political power base in the south of [LOC Afghanistan] where most opium is produced . [PER Karzai] has stated commitment to eliminating corruption and battling the drug trade . [PER Oguz] stated on 28 July 2008 that corruption exists within the system but [LOC Afghanistan] lacked a well-trained police force for many years and officials are only now taking steps in fighting corruption . 2008-08-25 [LOC Afghanistan] ( [LOC AF] ) International ; terrorism ; Government ; narcotics ; crime [LOC Afghanistan] 's counter-narcotic police have confiscated 1.2 metric tons ( 1.3 tons ) of opium during a raid . In 2007 [LOC Afghanistan] accounted for 93 percent of the world 's opium supply . On 25 August 2008 [LOC Afghanistan] 's [ORG Interior Ministry] announced in a statement that -- [LOC Afghanistan] 's counter-narcotic police confiscated 1.2 metric tons ( 1.3 tons ) of opium during a raid in southern [LOC Afghanistan] . The 1.2 metric tons of opium was seized on 19 August 2008 in Marjah district of [LOC Helmand] province . 3 smugglers were detained . In 2007 [LOC Afghanistan] accounted for 93 percent of global opium supply . [LOC Helmand] province is the world 's largest producer of opium . In 2007 [LOC Afghanistan] produced 8200 metric tons ( 9000 tons ) of opium . Opium is the main ingredient in heroin production . The multibillion-dollar opium trade helps fund the [MISC Taliban-led] insurgency . The multibillion-dollar opium trade may finance corrupt government officials . 2008-08-26 [LOC Estonia] ( EE ) ; [LOC Georgia] ( [ORG GE] ) International ; Telecom ; technology ; crime [LOC Estonia] is hosting some [MISC Georgian] websites to protect the websites from hackers . Officials stated on August 26 , 2008 that [LOC Estonia] is temporarily hosting the websites of [LOC Georgia] 's [ORG Central Bank] and [ORG Foreign Ministry] as well as a [MISC Georgian] [ORG English-languages] news portal in order to protect the websites from cyber attacks . The state-run [MISC Estonian] informatics Center stated that [LOC Georgia] has transferred key websites to services in other countries including [LOC Poland] and [LOC France] after some came under attack following the outbreak of war with [LOC Russia] . [MISC Estonian] informatics center spokeswoman [PER Katrin pargmae] stated that hosting websites in different countries makes the websites more complicated and time-consuming for hackers to disrupt . [PER Katrin] pargmae also stated that hosting the websites will help [LOC Georgia] 's webpages be visible to the world . [PER Katrin] pargmae did not comment on the [MISC Georgian] attacks . [LOC Estonia] has previous experience coping with cyber attacks because [MISC Estonian] government and private sector websites were targeted in May 2007 . The May 2007 attacks were days after [LOC Estonia] decided to relocate a [MISC Soviet] war memorial and grave . The relocation angered [LOC Estonia] 's ethnic [MISC Russian] minority and neighboring [LOC Russia] . [MISC Estonian] officials did not accuse any country of mounting what the [MISC Estonian] Government stated were highly organized and professional attacks . [LOC Estonia] is a [MISC Baltic] state . 2008-09-03 [LOC Europe] International ; money ; terrorism ; crime ; business The [ORG European Union] 's highest court on September 3 , 2008 overturned a verdict to freeze the assets of multiple individuals and groups accused of funding terrorist organizations . The [ORG European Union] 's highest court on September 3 , 2008 overturned a 2001 decision by [ORG European Union] governments to freeze the assets of a [MISC Saudi] businessman and a [MISC Sweden-based] charity suspected of funding [ORG Al-Qaida] terror groups . The ruling conflicts with a [ORG United Nations] anti-terror order obliging [ORG United Nations] Member States to freeze assets of people and entities suspected of funding terror groups . The [ORG European Union] 's highest court also stated that the [ORG United Nations] order failed to offer individuals on a terror blacklist or individuals on the defense any legal rights to a judicial review under [MISC European] law . The [ORG European Union] 's highest court acknowledged that the reasons for freezing the assets of [PER Yasin Al-Qadi] and the [ORG Al-Barakaat International Foundation] may be justified . It is not known whether [ORG European Union] nations which have set up a joint terror blacklist will unfreeze the assets . None of the groups have so far been officially removed from the blacklist because [ORG European Union] Governments argue the court rulings do not oblige the [ORG European Union] nations to remove the names from the list but only force the [ORG European Union] to inform the individuals and groups on the list that the assets have been frozen . Head of the [ORG Saudi-based Muwafaq Foundation] [PER Yasin Al-Qadi] appealed against the [ORG European Union] 's decision to freeze proprietary assets . [LOC United States] Treasury officials allege the [ORG Muwafaq Foundation] is an [ORG al-Qaida Front] used to funnel millions of dollars and euros to [ORG al-Qaida] . [ORG Al-Barakaat International] appealed the [ORG European Union] 's decision to freeze 1 million [MISC Swedish] kroner or 152247 [LOC United States] dollars . Lawyers for [ORG Al-Barakaat International] stated that the money was being used to fund aid programs for families in [LOC Somalia] . [PER Thomas Olsson] stated that the lawyers for [ORG Al-Barakaat International] would now examine ways of having the assets released to the [MISC Somali] immigrants in [LOC Sweden] who used the network to send funds to relatives in [LOC Somalia] . [PER Thomas Olsson] also stated that the lawyers for [ORG Al-Barakaat International] have to examine the judicial consequences of the verdict as the sanctions remain on a [ORG United Nations] level . The [ORG European Union] 's highest court stated on September 3 , 2008 that the 27-nation [ORG European Union] is required to inform any person whose assets are being frozen why as swiftly as possible after the decision is taken in order to allow the person with frozen assets the right to legal recourse . [MISC Swedish] lawyer [PER Thomas Olsson] who represented [ORG Al-Barakaat] in the case approved of the ruling . This ruling may hinder international efforts to stop the financing of terror groups including [ORG al-Qaida] . The ruling overturns an earlier 2005 [ORG European Union] court decision that rejected the appeals of [PER Al-Qadi] and the [ORG Al-Barakaat] international foundation . The ruling stated that the lower [ORG European Union] 's court judgment erred in law by stating that [ORG European Union] courts had no jurisdiction to review the legality of the contested order to freeze assets of individuals and groups deemed to be funding terror groups by the [ORG United Nations] . Other suspects and groups on an [ORG European Union] terror blacklist have also won legal victories for similar reasons against being listed . These suspects and groups have so far not had assets unfrozen or names removed from the [ORG European Union] 's blacklist . The [ORG European Union] 's High Court had previously overturned an [ORG European Union] decision to freeze the assets of the [ORG People] 's [MISC Mujahadeen] of [LOC Iran] . [ORG The People] 's [MISC Mujahadeen] of [LOC Iran] is an exiled [MISC Iranian] Resistance movement that is on the [ORG European Union] 's terror blacklist . The [ORG European Union] 's High Court recently overturned a decision to freeze the assets of an exiled [LOC Philippine] rebel leader and the [ORG Netherlands-based Al-Aqsa Foundation] because the leader and group were not informed why the assets were frozen which is a breach of [ORG EU] law . 370 people have had assets frozen because of placement on a terrorist blacklist by the [ORG United Nations] Security Council . The [ORG European Union] 's blacklist also targets about 60 organizations . 2008-09-03 [LOC Brazil] ( [ORG BR] ) Weapons ; technology ; international [LOC Brazil] 's Strategic Affairs Minister [PER Roberto mangabeira Unger] stated [LOC Brazil] 's new national defense plan calls for establishing partnerships with countries including [LOC Russia] and [LOC France] to build a state-of-the-art weapons industry . [LOC Brazil] 's Strategic Affairs Minister [PER Roberto mangabeira] [PER Unger] stated on 3 September 2008 that [MISC Brazilian] government plans to rebuild [LOC Brazil] 's weapons industry with the help of technology developed in other countries . [PER Unger] stated [LOC Brazil] 's new national defense plan calls for establishing partnerships with countries including [LOC Russia] and [LOC France] to build a state-of-the-art weapons industry . [PER Unger] stated such technology transfers would involve a significant element of [ORG Research and Development in] [LOC Brazil] . [PER Unger] stated the week of 24 August 2008 that the [MISC Brazilian] Government is considering a significant increase in defense spending which currently stands at 1.5 percent of gross domestic product . [LOC Brazil] 's GDP was approximately 1.5 trillion [LOC US] dollars in 2007 . 2008-09-12 [LOC Sweden] ( [LOC SE] ) International ; money ; terrorism ; crime On September 9 , 2008 [MISC Swedish] Prosecutor [PER Ronnie Jacobsson] dropped charges against the 3 [MISC Swedes] arrested on suspicion of funding terrorism . [MISC Swedish] Prosecutor [PER Ronnie Jacobsson] stated on September 9 , 2008 that charges will not be pressed against the 3 [MISC Swedes] arrested on suspicion of funding terrorism earlier in 2008 . The charges are being dropped because [PER Ronnie] jaccobson cannot provide that the men had intended to send money to terrorist organizations . The [MISC Swedes] were accused of using the informal money transfer networks called hawalas to send funds to alleged terror groups in [LOC Somalia] . The 3 [MISC Swedes] were arrested in raids in [LOC Stockholm] in February . The raid was coordinated with a crackdown in [LOC Norway] where another 3 suspects were arrested on similar grounds . [PER Ronnie Jacobsson] stated that the [MISC Norwegian] investigation is still ongoing . The 3 [MISC Swedes] are 30 or 40 years old . Hawalas are a paperless system based on trust and oral agreements which is commonly used in the [LOC Middle East] and parts of [LOC Asia] and [LOC Africa] . Defense lawyer [PER Thomas Olsson] stated it was very tragic and a failure for [MISC Swedish] law and order that the client [PER Thomas Olsson] was representing had been kept in detention for such a long time despite the weak evidence against client . 2 of the men were held for more than 3 months before being released at the start of the summer of 2008 . [PER Ronnie Jacobsson] stated that a court had examined the detention order every 2 weeks and found there was reason to keep the men detained . Both [LOC Norway] and [LOC Sweden] have been spared violent terror acts but authorities in both countries have voiced concern about terrorists or terror financiers operating out of [LOC Scandinavia] . In 2005 2 [MISC Iraqis] were sentenced to prison in [LOC Sweden] for collecting and transferring money to terrorist [PER Abu Musab al-Zarqawi] . [PER Abu Musab al-Zarqawi] is the late leader of [ORG al-Qaida] in [LOC Iraq] . 2008-09-26 [LOC Russian Federation] ( [MISC RU] ) International ; military ; technology ; leader ; space ; weapons [LOC Russian Federation] plans to upgrade [LOC Russia] 's nuclear deterrent and modernize the military in light of a recent war with [LOC Georgia] . President [PER Dmitry Medvedev] has ordered an upgrade of the [LOC Russian Federation] 's nuclear deterrent and the modernization of [MISC Russian] armed forces . This upgrade includes plans to build a new air and space defense network and to begin large-scale production of warships including nuclear submarines . President [PER Dmitry Medvedev] stated that the [LOC Russian Federation] must make the modernization of the military a priority in light of the recent war with [LOC Georgia] . President [PER Dmitry Medvedev] made this statement on September 26 , 2008 during a meeting with officers after military exercises in the southern [LOC Orenburg] region . President [PER Dmitry Medvedev] 's statement was posted on the [LOC Kremlin] website and carried in full by state news agencies . President [PER Dmitry Medvedev] stated that the [MISC Russian] army must be modernized by 2020 .

[PER Medvedev] plans to have a guaranteed nuclear deterrent system in place by 2020 which will include warships and nuclear-powered submarines . [MISC Russian] president [PER Dmitry Medvedev] stated on 26 September 2008 that the [MISC Russian] military must modernize armed forces and upgrade nuclear deterrent by building a new air and space defense network . [PER Medvedev] also announced plans to begin large-scale production of warships including nuclear-powered submarines armed with cruise missiles . [PER Medvedev] issued the statement to military commanders after military exercises in the southern [LOC Orenburg] region . The statement was posted on the [LOC Kremlin] web site and carried by state news agencies . [PER Medvedev] stated -- The need for modernization was demonstrated by the military conflict with [LOC Georgia] in August 2008 . [MISC Russian] military responded to [LOC Georgia] 's attack on the breakaway region of [LOC South Ossetia] with force and defeated the [MISC Georgian] army but the brief war highlighted [LOC Russia] 's aging arsenal . The [MISC Russian] military must ensure superiority in the air , in carrying out precision strikes at land and sea targets and in the timely deployment of forces . [LOC Russia] must have a guaranteed nuclear deterrent system in place by 2020 and gave military commanders until December 2008 to devise a plan . The [MISC Russian] military needs multi-purpose attack submarines and nuclear-powered submarines armed with cruise missiles . [PER Medvedev] did not mention the new borei-class nuclear submarines which are designed to carry a new intercontinental missile that is seen as a key future component of [LOC Russia] 's nuclear forces . The missile was successfully test fired the week of 14 September 2008 after several failures . The first of the new submarines is to be commissioned later in 2008 and 2 more are being built . [LOC Russia] 's economic problems after the 1991 [MISC Soviet] collapse affected the armed forces but the [LOC Kremlin] has recently been directing more money from oil profits into new weapons systems . 2008-10-20 [LOC Netherlands] ( [LOC NE] ) ; [LOC Russian Federation] ( [MISC RU] ) ; [LOC Georgia] ( [ORG GE] ) International ; weapons ; war and conflict ; Government ; military A [MISC Dutch] government investigation has found that a [MISC Russian] cluster bomb killed a television cameraman in [LOC Georgia] in 070000 . The [MISC Dutch] [ORG Foreign Ministry] said on 081020 that a [MISC Dutch] government investigation has found that a [MISC Russian] cluster bomb killed a television cameraman in [LOC Georgia] in 070000 . [MISC Dutchman] [PER Stan Storiman] died during the conflict over the breakaway province of [LOC South Ossetia] while filming the fighting in [LOC Gori] , [LOC Georgia] . Storimans was killed while filming on a large and nearly deserted square in [LOC Gori] . Reporter [PER Jeroen Akkermans] said several [MISC Georgian] civilians died in the same attack . [PER Akkermans] was working with Storimans and suffered minor injuries . Storimans was a veteran newsman employed by [ORG RTL Nieuws] . [ORG RTL Nieuws] is ultimately owned by [MISC German] media conglomerate [ORG Bertelsmann AG] . The [MISC Dutch] foreign ministry said a [MISC Dutch] investigative team sent to the spot 2 weeks later to gather forensic evidence and eyewitness accounts concluded Storimans was killed by a munition propelled by a type of rocket that is only found in [LOC Russia] 's military arsenal . [ORG Foreign] Minister [PER Maxime Verhagen] called the findings very serious . [PER Verhagen] said in a statement that [PER Verhagen] had made that clear to the [MISC Russian] authorities cluster munitions must not be used in this way . There were no troops present in [LOC Gori] and innocent civilians were killed . The [MISC Russian] government denied using cluster munitions during its brief war with [LOC Georgia] in 070800 . Human rights groups say both sides unleashed the widely denounced weapons . The georgiann Government has acknowledged using used ground-launched cluster munitions near the roki tunnel connecting [LOC South Ossetia] with [LOC Russia] . [PER Verhagen] said the [LOC Netherlands] Government plans to raise the matter with the [ORG Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe] . The [ORG Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe] addresses arms control issues and includes both [LOC Russia] and [LOC Georgia] as members . The [MISC Dutch] [ORG Foreign Ministry] said [MISC Dutch] government representatives will call for a political statement to be issued in which Member States pledge not to use cluster weapons in situations of this kind . Cluster bomblets are packed into artillery shells or bombs dropped from aircraft . A single container typically scatters some 200 to 600 of the mini-explosives over an area the size of a football field . Cluster bomblets have been criticized by human rights groups because they kill indiscriminately and because unexploded ordinance poses a threat to civilians similar to that of land mines . More than 100 countries agreed in [LOC Dublin] , [LOC Ireland] , in 080500 to ban cluster bombs within 8 years . Neither the [MISC Georgian] nor [MISC Russian] Governments signed the accord . 2008-10-23 [LOC France] ( [ORG FR] ) International ; money ; terrorism ; crime ; weapons A [ORG Paris Criminal Court] convicted nine people on October 23 , 2008 .

A [ORG Paris Criminal Court] convicted nine people on October 23 , 2008 . This included a [MISC French-Algerian] former prison inmate who admitted establishing an [MISC Islamic] group that called for armed Jihad in [LOC France] . Safe [PER Bourada] was sentenced to 15 years in prison . Eight others received penalties of one to nine years on charges linked to financing of and association with a terror group . [PER Bourada] admitted in court to creating a militant group called [PER Ansar Al-Fath] or partisans of victory . The group was suspected of planning attacks on the [LOC Paris] metro and [LOC Orly] airport . It was dismantled in 2005 after [MISC French] authorities received a tip from [MISC Algerian] counterparts . [PER Bourada] was one of 36 [MISC Islamic] militants convicted ten years ago for providing support for bombings that terrorized [LOC France] in 1995 . [PER Bourada] received a 10-year term , but won early release in 2003 under police surveillance . [PER Bourada] will not be eligible for parole for at least 10 years under the October 23 , 2008 verdict . Head of the counter-terrorism unit of the [ORG National Police] [PER Christophe chaboud] told the [ORG Associated Press] in 2005 that the group had had indirect contacts with [LOC Iraq] 's former al-Qaida leader [PER Abu Musab al-Zarqawi] . [PER Abu Musab al-Zarqawi] was killed in a [LOC U.S.] airstrike in June 2006 in [LOC Diyala] province . The court ruled that group member [PER Kaci] ouarab had received weapons training in [LOC Lebanon] in 2005 that was designed to help carry out bombings in [LOC France] .

Most of the nations that did not vote to move ahead with crafting the proposed arms trade treat abstained from 081031 vote . [LOC China] abstained from the 081031 vote . Only the [LOC United States] and [LOC Zimbabwe] voted against moving ahead with the treaty regulating the global arms trade . The [LOC United States] and [LOC Zimbabwe] were bitter opponents in 080700 concerning the [LOC United States-proposed] sanctions on [LOC Zimbabwe] 's leaders that were vetoed by [LOC Russia] and [LOC China] . Proponents of the treaty regulating the global arms trade stated that they hope to craft and adopt a treaty within 3 to 5 years with the aim of imposing controls on an international arms trade that contributes to the killing of more than 1000 people a day . [LOC Great] [LOC Britain] , [LOC Japan] , [LOC Australia] , [LOC Argentina] , [LOC Costa Rica] , [LOC Kenya] and [LOC Finland] have been leading proponents of the treaty regulating the global arms trade . [LOC Great Britain] is a 3 billion [LOC United States] dollar per year arms exporter . The treaty regulating the global arms trade would apply only to arms sales among nations and not commercial sales involving individuals . Decisions would require a simple majority . [PER John Duncan] stated that the treaty regulating the global arms trade has to be as universal as possible and that some the countries are arms manufacturers and that all nations are arms suppliers at one stage or another . [PER John Duncan] stated that it is by closing loopholes that nations can stop arms distribution into the hands of criminals and terrorists . [PER John Duncan] is [LOC Great Britain] 's ambassador for multilateral arms control and disarmament . The [LOC United States] favors language contained in some of the negotiating documents about treaty regulating the global arms trade that require consensus decisions that essentially give the [LOC United States] and other nations veto power . The [LOC United States] diplomat [PER Christina Rocca] stated that the only way to achieve a balanced and effective international mechanism for controlling trade in conventional arms is to proceed on a consensus basis . [PER Christina Rocca] made this statement to other nations assembled for the vote on moving ahead with the treaty regulating the global arms trade . In 061200 the [LOC United States] cast the sole dissenting vote when 153 nations voted in support of considering the creation of a treaty regulating the global arms trade . The 061200 vote set in motion the process of considering an arms trade treaty . That process included meetings from 071031 to 081031 among a group of experts that recommended items for consideration that included the consensus language . The 081031 vote will move forward arms trade treaty discussions toward the specifics of the possible language of the arms trade treaty . [PER Christina Rocca] stated that the [LOC United States] supports the goal of promoting responsibility in arms transfers and reducing the destabilizing trade in illicit arms . [PER Christina Rocca] stated that the [LOC United States] does not believe a global arms trade treaty would accomplish the promotion of responsibility in arms transfers and the reduction of the destabilizing trade in illicit arms . [PER Christina Rocca] stated that the only way to convince all major arms exporting countries to sign on to the arms trade treaty would be to weaken the arms trade treaty provisions and a weak arms trade treaty would legitimize an international standard based on a lowest common denominator that would not address the problem of illicit and irresponsible arms transfers . 2008-11-18 [LOC Iran] ( ( [ORG IR] ) Narcotics ; crime [MISC Iranian] state television stated that [MISC Iranian] police have killed 4 drug smugglers and have confiscated more than 1 ton of opium near the town of mirjaveh .

A 081121 report by the [ORG International Campaign to Ban Landmines] said [LOC Greece] , [LOC Turkey] and [LOC Belarus] have missed deadlines that were required under an international treaty to destroy their land mine stockpiles . Diplomats from [LOC Greece] , [LOC Turkey] and [LOC Belarus] declined to be interviewed about the report in [LOC Geneva] . The report quoted the Governments of [LOC Greece] , [LOC Turkey] and [LOC Belarus] as acknowledging that the deadlines have been missed . [LOC Greece] , [LOC Turkey] and [LOC Belarus] should have destroyed a total of nearly 7.5 million land mines by 080300 . The 1155-page annual report by the [ORG International Campaign to Ban Landmines] said [LOC Greece] mentioned legal problems with contracting a company to carry out the destruction and the difficulty of finding environmentally safe destruction sites as reasons for the delay . [LOC Turkey] 's government claimed preparations for getting rid of [MISC Turkish] stockpiles took longer than planned . [LOC Belarus] said there were delays in receiving support funds from the [ORG European Union] . [LOC Belarus] said remaining stockpiles contains a type of mine that is more difficult and costly to destroy .

The report said the number of destroyed stockpiled mines since the treaty to ban land mines came into force in 990000 has been brought to more than 42 million but that 44 countries still have 176 million mines . All of the 156 countries that have joined the Treaty are given 4 years to destroy their stockpiles . Major users of land mines such as the [LOC U.S.] , [LOC Russia] and [LOC China] have not signed the Treaty . The report said more than 1400 people were killed and 3900 wounded by land mine explosions worldwide in 070000 and added the number may be much higher because reporting is poor in many countries . The [ORG International Campaign to Ban Landmines] won the [MISC Nobel Peace Prize] in 970000 . 2008-11-25 [LOC Mexico] ( [ORG MX] ) Narcotics ; crime [MISC Mexican] football club owner and 4 team members are charged with trafficking cocaine and marijuana from [LOC Colombia] to the [LOC United States] .

The report was co-authored by former [ORG NATO] chief [PER George Robertson] and published by international [ORG think tank] the [MISC Institute for] [ORG Public Policy Research .] The report said there are 27 weak states that pose a threat to [LOC Britain] 's national security as the States could provide bases for terrorists . The countries include [LOC Haiti] , [LOC Nigeria] , [LOC Somalia] and [LOC Yemen] and have vulnerable Governments that are unwilling or unable to control the territories . The report 's authors stated criminal groups that fund terrorist organizations through drug trafficking and manufacturing counterfeit goods can operate in weak States without being detected . Terrorists who raise funds in these States could then coordinate an attack on [LOC Britain] . The report stated transnational terrorists have discovered that the global space is largely unregulated with the rule of law either weak or nonexistent and is a place where terrorists can operate with a reasonable prospect of impunity as in the mountains of [LOC Afghanistan] before 9/11 . Deputy Director of the ippr and 1 of the report 's authors [PER Ian kearns] stated terrorists could run camps in remote areas which Governments rarely monitor . [PER Kearns] referenced terrorist training camps in the [LOC Sahel] which is a region of [LOC sub-Saharan Africa] that runs though several countries including [LOC Mali] , [LOC Chad] and [LOC Sudan] . [PER Kearns] stated that these remote areas are impossible to patrol and any activity could go undetected . The report stated [MISC British] government must help to stabilize weak states and push for international regulations that would stop terrorists using freely available information to create and unleash new forms of biological warfare such as a modified version of the influenza virus . [PER Kearns] stated the Government must take a multilateral approach to areas including biotechnology but that the government is not moving quickly enough on the approach . [PER Kearns] stated the global financial crisis shows the results of not having multilateral frameworks in place to deal with international issues . 2008-01-28 [LOC China] ( [ORG CN] ) technology ; Government ; business [LOC China] 's Council of Agriculture opens a special office in charge of agricultural technology transfers and intellectual property rights management and consultancy to enhance development of [LOC China] 's knowledge-based agriculture and applications of agricultural technology . [LOC China] 's Council of agriculture ( [ORG COA] ) Deputy Minister [PER Lee Jen-chyuan] stated that the [ORG COA] under the Executive Yuan opened a special office in charge of agricultural technology transfers and intellectual property rights ( [ORG IPR] ) management and consultancy on 28 January 2008 . [PER Lee] stated that the establishment of the Agricultural Technology Promotion Agency will help increase the total amount of technological transfer contracts through 2011 to 500 million new [LOC Taiwan] dollars ( 15.46 million [LOC US] dollars ) . [PER Lee] stated that the [ORG COA] has spent the past several years setting up relevant mechanisms and drafting a set of promotional measures to enhance development of [LOC China] 's knowledge-based agriculture and applications of agricultural technology . [PER Lee] stated -- The [ORG COA] successfully promoted a total of 139 applications for technological transfer and intellectual property rights in 2007 which is an increase of 50 percent from the average of 90 cases per year from 2002 to 2006 . The total income derived from technological transfers conducted through the Council 's efforts amounted to 47.25 million [LOC NT] dollars which is an increase of 50 percent from the average of 12.93 million [LOC NT] dollars per year for the 2002-2006 period . [PER Lee] stated that the [ORG COA] will commission the [ORG Industrial Technology Research Institute] ( [LOC Itri] ) to carry out a special project on the management and application of agricultural [ORG R & D] achievements in order to upgrade agricultural technology research and development , protection , management and applications . An [LOC Itri] official stated that the Agricultural Technology Promotion Office will cooperate with world-renowned [ORG IPR] application institutions to push for revising the relevant regulations on [ORG IPR] and technological transfers and to enhance [ORG IPR] education and training . The [LOC Itri] official stated that the Office will serve as a platform to introduce various [ORG R & D] achievements realized by experimental and research institutes under the [ORG COA] to local businesses in an attempt to expand the application of agricultural technology . 2008-02-15 [LOC China] ( [ORG CN] ) International ; business ; money ; technology The [ORG Ministry of Economic Affairs] ( moea ) gave preliminary approval to 2 major [MISC China-bound] investment projects at a review meeting on 15 February 2008 . Minister [PER Steve reuy-long Chen] stated the 2 projects will have a positive effect on [LOC Taiwan] 's economic development . The [ORG Ministry of Economic Affairs] ( moea ) gave preliminary approval to 2 major [MISC China-bound] investment projects at a review meeting on 15 February 2008 . The 2 projects include [ORG Formosa Plastics Group] 's ( fpg 's ) plan to invest 100 million [LOC US] dollars in a specialty steel company in [LOC Zhangzhou] in [LOC Fujian] province and semiconductor packager and [PER Tester ASE] 's plan to increase investment in [ORG ASE] 's [LOC Shanghai] packaging plant by 30 million [LOC US] dollars . Minister [PER Steve reuy-long] [PER Chen] stated the 2 projects will have a positive effect on [LOC Taiwan] 's economic development . [PER Chen] made the statement after presiding over an [ORG Interministerial Conference] on whether the projects were in line with the Government 's active management and effective opening policy regarding investment in [LOC China] . [PER Chen] stated that the [ORG Investment Commission] under the [ORG Ministry of Economic Affairs] is expected to formally approve the projects the week of 17 February 2008 since the projects have passed policy-related screening . Fpg Chairman [PER Li Chih-chun] , [ORG Formosa Heavy Industry Corp] . President [PER Wu Kuo-hsiung] and [ORG ASE] Chairman [PER Jason Chang] attended the review meeting to explain investment plans and future business development blueprints in detail . The company chairmen and President reported on financing plans , technology transfer and equipment delivery as well as globalization plans and matching investment in [LOC Taiwan] . [PER Chen] stated fpg pledged an investment in [LOC Taiwan] that will reach 813.3 billion [LOC NT] dollars ( 25.67 billion [LOC US] dollars ) by 2013 and that related equipment will be produced in [LOC Taiwan] and delivered to [LOC China] . [PER Chen] stated fpg technical and management staff will be recruited in [LOC Taiwan] to create job opportunities . [PER Chen] stated [ORG ASE] has invested over 145 billion [LOC NT] dollars in [LOC Taiwan] and indicated increasing investment in [LOC Taiwan] depending on market circumstances . The review meeting is the 3rd policy-related screening meeting that the ministry has convened . The ministry previously approved investment projects by semiconductor manufacturers to relocate 8-inch-wafer plants using a 0.25-micron manufacturing process to [LOC China] . The Government approved an application by [ORG Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.] to use 0.18-micro chip manufacturing technology at the wafer foundry in [LOC China] . 2008-04-08 [LOC China] ( [ORG CN] ) Business ; technology ; economy The the [ORG Ministry of Economic Affairs] ( moea ) approved lingsen precision industries , King yuan electronics , [ORG IC Assembly] company [ORG Sigurd Corp.] and [MISC Siliconware] precision industries for [MISC Chinese] investment . On 8 April 2008 the [ORG Ministry of Economic Affairs] ( moea ) announced approval for 4 [MISC Chinese] investment proposals from [MISC Chinese] manufacturers . Lingsen precision industries , King yuan electronics , [ORG IC Assembly] company [ORG Sigurd Corp.] and [MISC Siliconware] precision industries were approved for investment and will invest in integrated circuit packaging ( [ORG ICP] ) and testing . The companies will invest 10 million [LOC US] dollars , 20 million [LOC US] dollars , 6.7 million [LOC US] dollars , and 50 million [LOC US] dollars respectively . The proposals have a total investment amount of 86.7 million [LOC US] dollars ( 2.64 billion [LOC NT] dollars ) . The moea determined in a meeting on 8 April 2008 that the investment proposals met the clauses in the [LOC China] Investment procedure issued by the ministry 's [ORG Investment Commission] . The [ORG Investment Commission] 's Executive Secretary [PER Fan Liang-Tung] stated the investment procedure aims to ensure [LOC Taiwan] 's investments in [LOC China] will not harm [LOC Taiwan] 's industries and economy such as by leaking key technologies to the mainland . Under the procedure investment plans require approval from the moea if the plans involve a single investment that exceeds 100 million [LOC US] dollars , the company 's total investment in [LOC China] reaches 200 million [LOC US] dollars , or the investment could transfer core local industries' technologies to [LOC China] . [ORG Fan] stated core industries mainly involve the manufacturing of 8-inch wafers and 4-inch TFT panels as well as [ORG IC] packaging . After the meeting on 8 April 2008 the [ORG Commission] requires written documents to further assess the plans which contain each company 's commitment on the terms of investment including the financial plan , information on any technology transfers and the company 's domestic investment as well as employment information . [ORG Fan] stated the [ORG Commission] is primarily concerned with the term of future investment in [LOC Taiwan] . [ORG Fan] stated lingsen precision industries , King yuan electronics , [ORG IC Assembly] company [ORG Sigurd Corp.] and [MISC Siliconware] precision industries have made commitments to return capital to [LOC Taiwan] in the amounts of 2 billion [LOC NT] dollars , 19.2 billion [LOC NT] dollars , 3 billion [LOC NT] dollars and 23 billion [LOC NT] dollars respectively by 2011 . [ORG Fan] stated the [ORG Commission] will ensure the commitments are upheld once the investments are under way . [ORG Fan] stated the procedure would push [MISC Chinese] investment from [LOC Taiwan] to focus on down scale manufacturers rather than technology-concentrated makers in a bid to keep high-end technologies in [LOC Taiwan] . [ORG Fan] stated the [ORG Commission] will hold a 2nd round of meetings to decide if the proposals will take effect and that the final decision will be made by 30 April 2008 . 2008-07-26 [LOC Iran] ( [ORG IR] ) International ; proliferation [PER Ahmadinejad] announces expansion of [MISC Iranian] uranium-producing capability . [LOC Iran] refuses commitment to halt expansion but hints a possible future halt . 20080726 [MISC Iranian] President [PER Mahmoud ahmadinejad] stated to scholars in the northeastern city of mashbad that [LOC Iran] had expanded its arsenal of centrifuges producing enriched uranium to over 5000 . The statement was ahmadinejad 's first asserting an expansion since the 20080400 announcement that [LOC Iran] was approaching the implementation of 6000 centrifuges . [LOC Iran] articulated the goal of 50000 centrifuges operating at the enrichment plant near the town of [LOC Natanz] . The international community has demanded that [LOC Iran] halt the production of nuclear material . Media reports differed on the number of centrifuges ahmadinejad cited . An [MISC Iranian] news agency reported that ahmadinejad stated [LOC Iran] had 6000 working centrifuges but the agency subsequently removed the statement from the [MISC Internet] . Another [MISC Iranian] news agency stated that ahmadinejad referred to 100000s of centrifuges . Experts discounted the significance of ahmadinejad 's claim in the absence of information on the centrifuges' functionality . A [MISC Western] diplomat in [LOC Tehran] speaking under condition of anonymity stated that the quantity of centrifuges is less important than whether the machines are operational and efficient but that ahmadinejad 's assertion will hinder a resolution of the diplomatic standoff between [LOC Iran] and the West . Arms control expert [PER Jeffrey G. Lewis] of the new [MISC America Foundation] think tank stated that the Foundation was aware of [LOC Iran] 's goal of assembling 6000 centrifuges but the operational status of the machines is unknown . Diplomats and arms control experts stated that the [MISC Iranian] enrichment program is hindered by technical problems . [LOC Iran] has repeatedly asserted that its nuclear program aims to produce only electricity because nuclear weapon production contradicts [MISC Islamic] principles . The [LOC US] , [LOC Israel] , [LOC Europe] and the majority of [MISC Western] arms control experts believe that [LOC Iran] is pursuing the capability to produce bombs immediately in the event of a decision . Experts stated that producing weapons-grade uranium from reactor-grade material is relatively simple . [PER Ahmadinejad] stated that after [LOC Iran] resisted the West 's demands for a halt in nuclear activities , the West still pursued the resumption of negotiations . [ORG EU] foreign policy chief [PER Javier Solana] recently presented [LOC Iran] with 2 offers -- A US-endorsed package of incentives to cease enriched uranium production A 6-week pre-negotiation' freeze for freeze' period during which [LOC Iran] would add no centrifuges and the West would refrain from promoting a 4th round of economic sanctions against [LOC Iran] at the [ORG UN Security Council] . [LOC US] officials repeatedly stated that no negotiations can begin before [LOC Iran] verifiably halts all enrichment-related activities but the [PER Bush] administration recently agreed to the' freeze for freeze' proposal and dispatch burns to [LOC Geneva] . 20080726 during talks in [LOC Geneva] attended by [LOC US] Undersecretary of State [PER William J. Burns] [LOC Iran] refused to respond to [PER Solana] 's offers . The talks constituted the highest-level diplomatic contact between the [LOC US] and [LOC Iran] for nearly 30 years . [PER Solana] , burns and [MISC European] envoys set a deadline for [LOC Iran] to respond positively before initiating new sanctions including prohibitions on selling [LOC Iran] refined petroleum products vital to the country 's economy . [MISC Iranian] officials refused to commit to stopping expansion or to observe the deadline . 20080726 ahmadinejad appeared to suggest that [LOC Iran] might potentially halt expansion at a higher number of centrifuges that previously expected and for over 6 weeks . [PER Ahmadinejad] stated that the West had consented to the existing 5000-6000 centrifuges in operation provided that the number did not increase . 5000 centrifuges can produce sufficient nuclear material for a power plant or an atomic bomb if the material is highly enriched . 6000 centrifuges running continuously can produce sufficient weapons-grade uranium for 1 bomb in 6 months . 20080500 the [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] stated that [LOC Iran] possessed 3500 centrifuges in operations . 2008-11-14 [LOC Iran] ( [ORG IR] ) ; [LOC Russian Federation] ( [MISC RU] ) ; [LOC China] ( [ORG CN] ) ; [LOC France] ( FR ) ; [LOC United States] ( [LOC US] ) International ; weapons ; proliferation ; Government ; politics ; energy A diplomatic meeting in [LOC Paris] concludes with no agreement on further steps to pressure [LOC Iran] to halt uranium enrichment at [LOC Iran] 's facility in [LOC Natanz] . On 081114 diplomats stated to the media that [MISC American] , [MISC European] , [MISC Russian] and [MISC Chinese] officials at a meeting on 081113 in [LOC Paris] did not reach agreement on further actions to persuade [LOC Iran] to halt uranium enrichment at [LOC Iran] 's facility in [LOC Natanz] . Uranium enrichment is a highly technical process that can produce fuel for a nuclear power plant or fissile material for atomic weapons . The 081113 meeting ended without any new measures to announce . After the 081113 meeting the [MISC French] foreign ministry released a statement declaring the international community had reaffirmed the importance of the dual-track approach of engaging diplomatically with [LOC Iran] and working towards sanctions . [LOC Russia] and [LOC China] have resisted new sanctions against [LOC Iran] . [LOC Russia] and [LOC China] have close political and business ties with [LOC Iran] and feel no domestic pressure to act against the [LOC Islamic Republic of Iran] . The [LOC United States] does not have close political and business ties with [LOC Iran] and feels domestic pressure to act against the [LOC Islamic Republic of Iran] . [LOC Russia] and [LOC China] hold veto power over [ORG Security Council] decisions . [LOC Moscow] 's [ORG Interfax] news agency quoted [MISC Russian] diplomat [PER Sergei ryabkov] as stating that the parties struck no deal on sanctions against [LOC Iran] at the 081113 meeting and that the [MISC Western] countries are in favor of the sanctions against [LOC Iran] while [LOC China] and [LOC Russia] did not support sanctions against [LOC Iran] . [PER Sergei ryabkov] attended the 081113 meeting . A report released this week says [LOC Iran] has made significant progress at [LOC Iran] 's heavy-water research reactor facility near the city of [LOC Arak] . [LOC Iran] 's heavy-water research reactor near [LOC Arak] could eventually produce plutonium that might be used in a nuclear weapon . Satellite images published by the [ORG Institute for Science and International Security] show construction at the heavy-water research reactor facility near the city of [LOC Arak] has progressed significantly between 080200 and 081000 . [PER David Albright] stated that [LOC Iran] 's heavy-water research reactor near [LOC Arak] has evaded the international security community 's notice . [PER David Albright] stated that [LOC Iran] 's heavy-water research reactor near [LOC Arak] is making significant progress according to the satellite images and that in a year and a half the heavy-water research reactor near [LOC Arak] has progressed from building frames to a largely finished facility . [PER David Albright] is a former arms inspector and Director of the [ORG Institute for Science and International Security] that is based in [LOC Washington] , [LOC D.C.] . [LOC Iran] stated that [LOC Iran] is pursuing nuclear technology to produce energy and conduct research . The [LOC United States] and its western allies suspect that [LOC Iran] 's efforts to produce is a precursor to creating a nuclear-weapons infrastructure . Low-grade uranium production is legal under international arms-control regulations . The latest developments in [LOC Iran] 's nuclear technology development show the complex diplomatic and technical challenges facing the incoming foreign policy team of [LOC United States] President-elect [PER Barack Obama] when it takes on the task of stopping [LOC Iran] from mastering technology that could be used to manufacture and deliver nuclear weapons . The administration of [LOC United States] President [PER George W. Bush] in its last months in power has managed to synchronize [LOC United States] policies with the [ORG European Union] , [MISC British] , [MISC French] and [MISC German] leaders , to press for tougher sanctions and diplomatic action against [LOC Iran] . The [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] is expected to release a report critical of [LOC Iran] next week . The [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] is the [ORG United Nations] 's nuclear watchdog agency . Due to the Act that no new initiatives regarding [LOC Iran] 's nuclear program emerged from the 081113 [LOC Paris] talks the hopes of imposing another set of [ORG United Nations Security Council] sanctions before the end of President [PER Bush] 's term were decreasing . While diplomatic maneuvering is taking place [LOC Iran] continues to work towards mastering nuclear and missile technology . Some [MISC Israeli] officials have stated their alarm about [LOC Iran] 's test-firing this week of a solid-fuel , two-stage rocket with a range of 1200 miles . The city of [LOC Tel Aviv] is fewer than 650 miles from [MISC Iranian] territory . 2008-08-08 [LOC Georgia] ( [ORG GE] ) ; [LOC Russian Federation] ( [MISC RU] ) International ; Government ; dissent ; war and conflict ; weapons ; politics On 8 August 2008 [LOC Russia] conducted airstrikes on [MISC Georgian] targets . The airstrikes escalated conflict in a separatist area of [LOC Georgia] . On 8 August 2008 [LOC Russia] conducted airstrikes on [MISC Georgian] targets . The airstrikes escalated conflict in a separatist area of [LOC Georgia] . The conflict is a test of [LOC Russia] 's power and military reach . Earlier on 8 August 2008 [MISC Russian] troops and armored vehicles entered [LOC South Ossetia] . Presence of [MISC Russian] troops supported the separatist area in its bitter conflict with [LOC Georgia] . The [LOC U.S.] , other [MISC Western] nations and [ORG NATO] condemned the violence . The [LOC U.S.] , other [MISC Western] nations and [ORG NATO] demanded a cease-fire . [LOC U.S.] Secretary of State [PER Condoleezza Rice] demanded [LOC Russia] withdraw its forces . [MISC Russian] soldiers remained in [LOC Georgia] . [MISC Georgian] officials report there was at least 1 airstrike on the [LOC Black Sea] port of [LOC Poti] late on 8 August 2008 . [LOC Russia] and [LOC Georgia] showed no indication of relenting . [MISC Russian] Prime Minister [PER Vladimir V. Putin] stated that war has started . [MISC Georgian] President [PER Mikheil Saakashvili] accused [LOC Russia] of a well-planned invasion . [LOC Georgia] mobilized military reserves . On 8 August 2008 [MISC Georgian] government web sites crashed intermittently . The crashes are signs of a cyber-warfare campaign against [LOC Georgia] . The dispute could renew a sustained conflict in the [LOC Caucasus] region . The Caucus region is an important conduit for the flow of oil from the [LOC Caspian Sea] to world markets . Conflict in the caucus region has lasted for years along [LOC Russia] 's borders . The conflict has taken place most recently in [LOC Chechnya] . [LOC Russia] 's military incursion into [LOC Georgia] indicates [LOC Russia] 's confidence and resolve . [LOC Russia] 's military incursion provided a test of the capacities of the [MISC Russian] military . [PER Putin] attempted to modernize and re-equip the [MISC Russian] military during his 2 presidential terms . Earlier in 2008 [LOC Russia] announced it was broadly expanding support for the separatist regions . [LOC Georgia] labeled [LOC Russia] 's support an act of annexation . Throughout 8 August 2008 reports conflicted about whether [MISC Georgian] or [MISC Russian] forces had won control of [LOC Tskhinvali] . Late on 8 August 2008 it was unclear whether ground combat had taken place between [MISC Russian] and [MISC Georgian] soldiers or had been limited to fighting between separatists and [MISC Georgian] forces . [LOC Tskhinvali] is the capital of [LOC Georgia] . [LOC Georgia] is mountainous . [LOC Georgia] is a rebel province . 2008-09-19 [LOC Iraq] ( IQ ) International ; Telecom ; technology ; crime ; leader ; media ; dissent [ORG Iranian News Agency Fars] stated that hackers known as group [ORG XP] defaced or blocked 100s of Shiite-related websites . The official website of [LOC Iraq] 's [MISC Shiite] leader the [PER Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani] was among the websites defaced and blocked . Group [ORG XP] stated on the defaced website that any website that contained material contrary to [MISC Sunni] teachings would be hacked . The official website of [LOC Iraq] 's [MISC Shiite] religious leader the [PER Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani] was defaced and blocked in a sectarian-motivated cyber attack on Shiite-related sites . It was not clear whether the attack began on 18 September 2008 or the morning of 19 September 2008 . By the evening of 19 September 2008 [PER Al-Sistani] 's website was offline . Another website related to 1 of [PER Al-Sistani] 's religious organizations , www.al-shia.com , was also affected . An alternative address , www.sistani.com , was still operational . [ORG Iranian News Agency Fars] stated that group [ORG XP] had blocked access to approximately 300 Shiite-related sites on 18 September 2008 and 19 September 2008 . Neither the hacking claim nor an [MISC Iranian] assertion that group [ORG XP] was based in the [LOC United Arab Emirates] could be verified independently . Several [MISC Iranian] news sites stated on 19 September 2008 that many of the [MISC Shiite] and [MISC Iran-related] web sites that had been attacked were running normally again . A statement signed group [ORG XP] was posted on the home page of [PER Al-Sistani] 's web site and stated that the attack was on behalf of [MISC Sunni] Muslims . The statement said -- Group [ORG XP] had carried out similar attacks on other [MISC Shiite] sites in the [LOC Persian Gulf] and [LOC Iraq] . Group [ORG XP] erased the site as group [ORG XP] has done with other Rafidha sites . Rafidha means rejecters and is an insult used by [MISC Sunni] extremists to describe [MISC Shiites] . [PER Al-Sistani] promoted sexual deviance and an [MISC Iranian] agenda in [LOC Iraq] as [PER Al-Sistani] was born in [LOC Iran] . Any website with material that was contrary to [MISC Sunni] teachings would be punished . The statement also consisted of a youtube video clip of [MISC American] comedian [PER bill Maher] ridiculing a fatwa by [PER Al-Sistani] on whether certain positions of sexual intercourse were permitted for married couples . The ayatollah 's office in [LOC Najaf] declined to comment on the cyber attack . [ORG Fars] reported that a counterattack had been carried out against 2 major [MISC Wahhabi] web sites which belong to puritanical strain of [PER Sunni Islam] that is dominant in [LOC Saudi Arabia] . 2008-10-08 [LOC Somalia] ( SO ) ; [LOC Ukraine] ( [ORG UA] ) ; [LOC Kenya] ( [LOC KE] ) Crime ; weapons ; international ; money [MISC Somali] pirates who hijacked a [MISC Ukrainian] freighter carrying a large cargo of arms are approaching a deal for the ship 's release . Questions have emerged regarding the shipment of arms en route to [LOC Kenya] and of a possible clandestine arms deal between [LOC Kenya] and [LOC South Sudan] . On 08 October 2008 Maritime officials and associates of the [MISC Somali] pirates who on 25 September 2008 hijacked a [MISC Ukrainian] freighter carrying a large cargo of arms stated that the pirates may soon be collecting their ransom . After difficult negotiations likened by several people involved to bazaar-style haggling the parties are close to reaching a deal in which the pirates would be paid millions of dollars and the ship freed . A businessman in xarardheere , [LOC Somalia] named [PER Ahmed Omar] stated that the pirates and the ship owners have agreed on a ransom of approximately 8 million [LOC U.S.] dollars and the ship may be freed on 08 October 2008 or 09 October 2008 . Xarardheere is a notorious pirate base on the coast of [LOC Somalia] . Maritime officials in [LOC Kenya] stated that critical details have yet to be agreed upon . One such detail involves the pirates' request for a guarantee that they would not be arrested or attacked by the armada of [MISC American] warships currently encircling them . A [MISC Kenyan] maritime official stated anonymously that such negotiations are complex and involve more than the financial aspect . On 08 October 2008 the official stated that progress is being made and the parties are approaching an agreement . The pirates initially requested 35 million [LOC U.S.] dollars and then reduced their request to 20 million [LOC U.S.] dollars . The pirates have consistently expressed willingness to negotiate the financial figures . More than 25 ships have been hijacked in 2008 off the [LOC Somalia] coast with a typical ransom of between 1 and 2 million [LOC U.S.] dollars . The pirates aboard the [MISC Ukrainian] ship have stated that upon receipt of payment in [MISC American] dollars and preferably in 100 dollar bills the ship , its cargo and the 20 sailors on board will be released . The original country of destination for the arms shipment aboard the [MISC Ukrainian] ship is being questioned . Shortly after the freighter was hijacked on 25 September 2008 the [MISC Kenyan] government claimed that the weapons on board were being shipped for [LOC Kenya] 's military . The ship was en route to [LOC Kenya] 's main port of [LOC Mombasa] . The weapons on board the ship included 33 T-72 tanks , 150 grenade launchers , 6 anti-aircraft guns and a large quantity of ammunition . Evidence has subsequently emerged that the weapons were part of a clandestine arms deal between [LOC Kenya] and the separatist region of southern [LOC Sudan] . The deal would most likely have remained secret had the pirates not hijacked the ship and begun speaking to the media by satellite phone . [MISC Ukrainian] officials have been adamant in denying any wrongdoing . [MISC Ukrainian] diplomat in [LOC Kenya] oleh belokolos stated -- [LOC Ukraine] does not supply or have plans to supply any armaments to the Government of [LOC South Sudan] . All the appropriate paperwork has been validated . [LOC Ukraine] abides by all [ORG United Nations] rules and arms control agreements . [LOC Ukraine] inherited enormous stockpiles of weaponry after the collapse of the [LOC Soviet Union] and is now a major arms dealer . The deal with [LOC Ukraine] is considered suspicious given that [LOC Kenya] has mostly relied on the [LOC United Kingdom] and other western countries for its supply of heavy weapons . [MISC Kenyan] politicians were demanding answers and have called for several commissions to examine the situation . [LOC Southern Sudan] is an autonomous region that is currently increasing its military and that uses Soviet-designed tanks . The [MISC American] military stated that its priority is to ensure that the weapons were not unloaded from the ship and sold to [MISC Islamist] insurgents in [LOC Somalia] . The pirates have denied interest in the weapons and claimed to have been unaware that the cargo included tanks when they hijacked the ship . Pirate spokesman sugule [PER Ali] stated in an interview last week that the pirates' sole interest in the deal is money . 2008-11-28 [LOC Afghanistan] ( [LOC AF] ) Narcotics Head of the [ORG U.N.] drug office [PER Antonio Maria Costa] said that [LOC Afghanistan] has produced so much opium in recent years that the [ORG Taliban] are cutting back poppy cultivation and stockpiling raw opium in an effort to support prices and preserve a major source of financing for the insurgency . Head of the [ORG U.N.] drug office [PER Antonio Maria Costa] said that [LOC Afghanistan] has produced so much opium in recent years that the [ORG Taliban] are cutting back poppy cultivation and stockpiling raw opium in an effort to support prices and preserve a major source of financing for the insurgency . [PER Costa] said this to reporters last week as the [ORG U.N. Drug Office Office] prepared to release its latest survey of [LOC Afghanistan] 's opium crop . The survey showed that poppy cultivation had retreated in much of [LOC Afghanistan] and was overwhelmingly concentrated in 7 of 34 provinces where the insurgency remains strong , most of those in the south . The survey was issued November 27 , 2008 . The [ORG United Nations] found that the result was a 19 percent reduction in the amount of land devoted to opium in [LOC Afghanistan] even though the total tonnage of opium produced dropped by just 6 percent . The study stated that the high output per acre was attributed to a good growing season in the south . The southern region is a heavily irrigated area where the [ORG Taliban] maintained a strong presence in 5 provinces and have systematically encouraged opium cultivation as a way to finance their insurgency for several years . The [ORG U.N.] estimates the insurgents made as much as 300 million dollars from the opium trade last year . [PER Costa] said a lot of war effort can be funded with 2 to 300 million dollars . The [ORG Taliban] have producing an amount of opium that far exceeds world demand due to 3 successive years of bumper crops . [PER Costa] said the result was a glut that was depressing the price , which dropped by approximately 20 percent . [PER Costa] said that the fact that prices had not collapsed already was evidence that the [ORG Taliban] , drug lords and even some farmers have stockpiled the opium . An increasing amount is also being processed in [LOC Afghanistan] . [PER Costa] added that insurgents have been holding significant amounts of opium . [PER Costa] said the surplus is as much as 11000 tons , or more than twice world demand in the last 3 years and threatened to devalue their stockpiles . The [ORG United Nations] found that [LOC Afghanistan] produced 8500 tons of opium in 2008 . World demand was estimated at about 4400 tons per year . The [ORG Taliban] this year are taking a passive stance toward cultivation and putting less pressure on [MISC Afghan] farmers to plant opium poppy . This then supports the current price . [PER Costa] is an [MISC Italian] diplomat who has served at the [ORG U.N. Office] on Drugs and Crime for 6 years .
