Karras faces at least 5 years ' imprisonment and a minimum 5 strokes of the cane if convicted but would escape the death penalty sentence mandatory for anyone caught trafficking more than 500 grams of cannabis .
The arrest of Karras comes more than a year after the highly publicized hanging of Australian Nguyen Tuong van .
