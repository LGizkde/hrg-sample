A newspaper report on January 1, 2008 that Iran hanged two convicted drug traffickers in the southeastern city of Zahedan.
This brings the number of executions for 2007 to at least 297.
The hardline Kayhan newspaper said the men were identified as Mehdi Rigi Javan and Naser hedieh sasooli and were hanged in prison on December 31, 2007 for trafficking 59 kilos (130 pounds) of heroin.
An AFP count compiled from local press reports stated that the executions brought the number of people hanged in Iran in 2007 to at least 297.
This figure well exceeds the 177 convicted criminals executed in 2006 According to Amnesty International.
Iran is currently the leader in death penalty executions after China.
The number of executions increased in Iran last year amid a campaign that is aimed at improving security in society.
The campaign has been aimed at arresting drug-traffickers, rapists and those deemed a social menace.
Dozens of such criminals have been hanged in public.
Several executions have occurred in major cities.
Capital offences in Iran include murder, rape, armed robbery, serious drug trafficking and adultery.
Rights groups have accused Iran of employing the death penalty excessively.
Authorities say capital punishment is an effective deterrent that is only used after an exhaustive judicial process.

US experts report Chinese plans to dispatch troops to North Korea and secure North Korea's nuclear arsenal in the event of instability.
A report compiled by experts from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the US Institute of Peace and the Asia Foundation stated that China has contingency plans to dispatch Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops to North Korea and secure nuclear weapons in the event of instability in North Korea.
The experts visited China 20070600 to confer with Chinese military researchers.
The report stated --
China's strong preference is to receive formal authorization and coordinate closely with the UN in any possible intervention.
China would take unilateral action to restore stability if the international community did not react in a timely manner as the internal order in North Korea deteriorated rapidly.
The report stated --
PLA researchers claim that contingency plans exist for the PLA to perform three possible missions in North Korea -- humanitarian, peacekeeping and environmental control.
The environmental control measures are intended to clean up nuclear contamination resulting from a strike on North Korean nuclear facilities near the Sino-North Korean border and to secure nuclear weapons and fissile materials.
The report stated --
China's main priority in the event of instability in North Korea would be prevention of an influx of refugees by assuring supplies of food and strengthening border controls.
PLA officers stated that they would attempt to close the border but admit a lack of confidence that they could do so successfully because the border extends 866 miles and can be easily penetrated.
North Korea reportedly possesses up to 10 nuclear bombs but is currently involved in a denuclearization program in return for energy aid and diplomatic and security guarantees under a six-party mechanism involving the United States, China, Russia, South Korea and Japan.
The program recently encountered difficulties when the US accused North Korea of failing to meet the 20071231 deadline for a full declaration of nuclear programs.
The report was published on the websites of us think tanks the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the US Institute of Peace and is entitled "keeping an eye on an unruly neighbor -- Chinese views of economic reform and stability in North Korea."

Sarkozy stated that denying Arab nations civilian nuclear power on the basis of being Arab gives credence to Iran's argument.
For Francois heisbourg of the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) stated --
France's strategy depends on highlighting Iran's error in defying the international community over the nuclear issue.
Non-nuclear countries will be difficult to mobilize against Iran if they are treated the same way as Iran.
Some are concerned over the potential risk of supplying nuclear technology to Arab States because the region is unstable and dominated by authoritarian regimes and Islamic extremism.
German energy minister Gernot Erler stated in response to France's decision to provide nuclear technology to Libya that the risk of proliferation goes up with every country that uses nuclear energy.
French environmentalists stated that Sarkozy is not sufficiently addressing concerns about human rights, the environment and international security.
Jean-Pierre maulny of France's Institute for International and Strategic Relations (IRIS) stated that associated with the spread of civilian nuclear energy in a sensitive region is the risk of military nuclear programs unless control is absolute.
Heisbourg stated that the potential for proliferation associated with French civilian nuclear aid is outweighed by the risk of covert program based on technology transferred from countries such as Pakistan.
Iran is suspected of concealing military ambitions of its clandestine nuclear programs and is subject to international sanctions due to refusing to comply with UN demands.

Britain apologizes to and compensates veterans mislead in Cold War chemical weapons trials.
Victims claim negative health effects and 1 death.
20080131 British Defense Minister Derek twigg stated in a written answer to parliament --
The Defense Ministry had apologized and awarded 3 million pounds in compensation to 360 former service personnel claiming to have been mislead into participating in chemical weapons trials during the cold war.
The ministry had not admitted liability and the payment constituted a full and final amicable settlement.
Twigg stated --
The Government accepts that there were defective aspects of the trials in which the life or health of participants may have been endangered.
The trials were frequently under considerable pressures of time as new threats emerged.
The Government acknowledges the debt Britain owes to the victims of the trials.
The veterans claim to have been informed that they were volunteering for cold remedy tests and have suffered ill-health as a result.
The trials occurred at the government's military chemical and biological defense research facility at Porton Down in southwest England in the 1950s and 1960s.
In 1953 20-year-old Royal Air Force Engineer Ronald Maddison was killed when the nerve agent sarin was dropped on Maddison's arm at Porton Down.
The inquest held confidentially on national security grounds shortly after Maddison's death gave a verdict of misadventure.

On 080204 India and Pakistan signed an accord to exchange security information.
Officials stated that on 080204 India and Pakistan signed an accord to exchange security information.
This Accord opened up a new channel of communication between India and Pakistan.
India and Pakistan are nuclear-armed rivals.
The accord makes conditions possible for regular contacts between India's military-funded Institute of Defence Studies and analysis and Pakistan's state-run Institute for Strategic Studies.
The accord stipulates that the Institute of Defence Studies and analysis and Pakistan's state-run Institute for Strategic Studies will send experts to participate in state-sponsored workshops in India and Pakistan and later engage in joint military research projects.
The Institute of Defence Studies and analysis and the Institute for Strategic Studies are 2 mutually-suspicious think tanks.
Shireen Mazari stated at the accord signing ceremony in New Delhi that the purpose of the accord is to build channels of communication at the level of scholars and that exchanges of security studies had been limited in the past because of the strained ties between India and Pakistan.
Shireen Mazari is the director of Pakistan's Institute for Strategic Studies.
Narendra sisodia stated that the accord was a landmark because India and Pakistan have never had open discussions on security issues with the exception of contacts at international forums.
Narendra sisodia is the Head of India's Institute of Defense studies and analysis and a former Indian Defence Secretary.
Narendra sisodia stated with caution that the 080204 accord between the Institute of Defence Studies and analysis and the Institute for Strategic Studies would not replace any official dialogue.
India and Pakistan are South Asian rivals who have fought 3 wars since India and Pakistan's independence from British rule in 470000.
India and Pakistan set in motion a slow-moving peace process in 040000 only 5 years after they came dangerously close to a fourth conflict.
The 040000 peace process dialogue has led to closer Indian and Pakistani political contacts and greater transport links.
The armies of India and Pakistan have avoided direct contacts except for annual discussions on unresolved disputes.

Drug production will be a main focus of a meeting in Tokyo to assess progress in Afghanistan.
UN Office on Drugs and Crime representative Christina Oguz stated that Afghanistan has done little to stop the corruption enabling drug trade and Afghanistan's institutions are too weak to combat drug trade.
Oguz stated to AFP in an interview that the drug industry in Afghanistan produces more than 90 percent of the world's illegal opium and that ending the industry in Afghanistan will take decades.
Drug production escalated in 2007 and furthers deteriorating security.
Drug production will be a main focus of ministers, donors and aid agencies meeting in Tokyo on 5 February 2008 through 6 February 2008 to assess progress in Afghanistan.
A paper prepared for the talks said the expansion of the narcotics industry represents the single greatest threat to Afghanistan's stability and is increasingly linked to insecurity and terrorist activities.
The source of the document is the website of the joint coordination and monitoring board (jcmb) which is a committee working to implement Afghanistan's 5-year reconstruction plan.
The paper said the drug trade funds terrorism, fuels corruption and undermines the rule of law that should bring security to the people of Afghanistan.
The paper said traffickers provide weapons, funding and personnel to anti-government rebels while corrupt officials offer protection of drug trade routes, poppy fields and people.
6, Oguz stated a focus of the Tokyo talks will be the need for immediate action in lieu of talking.
Oguz stated --
The fact that President Hamid Karzai has not appointed a counternarcotics minister to replace the minister who resigned in July 2008 indicates the priority given to drug production even though Karzai has said drug production is 1 of the most important issues for Afghanistan to tackle.
Very little has been done to fight corruption.
Corruption feeds the industry in that farmers often have to pay a 10 percent tax to Afghan officials or Taliban insurgents.
Farmers must pay various bribes.
Farmers receive less than 1/4 of the 4 billion dollars that annual trade earns which is equal to more than 1/2 of the legal gross domestic product.
No one questions how people have very low salaries but drive in expensive cars and live in expensive houses.
Typically only the couriers are arrested.
Oguz stated bigger criminals are extremely difficult to find.
Some are not living in Afghanistan despite being Afghans.
Afghanistan's opium is increasingly converted into heroin inside Afghanistan and supplies drug users in Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East.
Oguz stated blaming Afghanistan for the world's heroin problem would be unfair as heroin production is a shared responsibility.
Chemicals needed to turn opium into heroin come primarily from the developed world and are illegally sent to Afghanistan.
Oguz stated the national strategy to deal with the drugs trade should be tailored to the different circumstances in the 34 provinces.
13 provinces were declared opium-free in 2007 which is double the figure from 2006.
Oguz stated --
The focus should be on interdiction in southern Afghanistan because of the common interest between insurgents and drug traffickers to keep the south out of reach from the government in Kabul and the international aid community.
The north and center of Afghanistan have more order and government structure and should be offered incentives like development to persuade farmers and other players to cease opium production.
Oguz stated the necessity of a long-term effort to combat the drug problem with Afghanistan rebuilding from below-scratch.
Oguz stated the drug trade links into corruption and the insurgency and will not be an easy task to combat.
Oguz stated combating the drug trade in Thailand took 20 years even though Thailand had some functioning institutions.

The Consortium for countering the financing of terrorism launched in Singapore on 12 February 2008 and aims to inhibit militants' access to funds in Southeast Asia.
The Association of Banks in Singapore, the Singapore Government and the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies launched the consortium in Singapore with plans for later involvement of other countries in the Asia Pacific region.
The Consortium aims to strengthen cooperation between banks, government agencies and academia to cut off funding for extremist groups.
Terrorism analyst and head of the Singapore-based International Centre for political violence and terrorism research Rohan Gunaratna stated the Consortium seeks to make the transfer of money difficult for extremist groups.
Gunaratna spoke to reporters on the sidelines of a closed-door Seminar on countering the financing of terrorism and stated militant groups including the Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) move between 2 and 3 million US dollars per month to fund terrorist activities in Southeast Asia.
Gunaratna stated the estimate was based on data gathered from the debriefing of captured militants, examination of documents seized from militant training camps and from intelligence reports.
Gunaratna stated groups involved in the fund transfers include the Abu Sayyaf and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front which both operate in the southern Philippines as well as the Southeast Asia-based JI and groups in southern Thailand and Indonesia.
Authorities blamed JI for bombings which killed mostly foreigners among 202 people on the Indonesian resort island of Bali in 2002 and a series of other attacks.
Gunaratna stated militant groups use the banking system, informal money transfers and couriers carrying bags filled with cash to transfer the funds.
Gunaratna stated a portion of the money is raised in Southeast Asia while some comes from the Middle East and other countries.

The International Atomic Energy Agency is the United Nations atomic watchdog.
Mohammed ElBaradei stated that Mohammed ElBaradei urged Iran to be as active and as cooperative as possible in working with the International Atomic Energy Agency to clarify the allegations of Iran's covert nuclear weapons program and that the allegations are of serious concern.
Mohammed ELBarade is the International Atomic Energy Agency's Director General.
On the first day of the 35-member board of governors meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency's regular March meeting Mohammed ElBaradei stated that Iran's active cooperation is necessary to enable the International Atomic Energy Agency to make a determination about the nature and scope of all of Iran's past nuclear activities.
The International Atomic Energy Agency's board of governors meeting in Vienna was expected to be held until 080305 or 080306.
At the International Atomic Energy Agency's board of governors meeting other issues including North Korea's stalled disarmament process were on the meeting's agenda.
Iranian issues were expected to dominate the International Atomic Energy Agency's board of governors meeting proceedings following the release of Mohammed ElBaradei's latest report on the Iranian government's disputed nuclear weapons ambitions.
The alleged Iranian covert nuclear weapons program issue was expected to be discussed by the International Atomic Energy Agency's board of governors on the afternoon of 080304.
Diplomats stated that moves were underway to draft a resolution to press the Iranian Government to address key concerns about alleged weaponisation studies.
If resolution currently underway is adopted then the resolution would be the first such resolution in 2 years.
In New York on 080303 the United Nations Security Council voted overwhelmingly to increase United Nations sanctions on Iran due to Iran's refusal to suspend Iran's sensitive nuclear fuel work.
Western countries fear the intent of Iran's sensitive nuclear fuel work is to develop nuclear weapons.
A resolution sponsored by Britain, France and Germany gained the backing of 14 of the United Nations Security Council's 15 members.
Indonesia abstained from voting on the resolution.
The vote to increase the United Nations sanctions on Iran had been planned for 080301.
The vote to increase the United Nations sanctions on Iran was delayed until 080303 to give the sponsors time to try to win over 4 reticent United Nations Security Council members.
The 4 reticent United Nations Security Council members were Indonesia, Libya, South Africa and Vietnam.
The Iranian government was allegedly involved in military research that indicated the development of non-conventional weapons according to recent intelligence presented to the International Atomic Energy Agency Board last week.
The Intelligence presented to the International Atomic Energy Agency Board was derived from a number of different independent sources and covered a uranium conversion project, high explosives tests and a missile re-entry vehicle modified to accommodate a possible nuclear warhead.
The Intelligence presented to the International Atomic Energy Agency Board suggested that Iran continued to work on nuclear weapons beyond the 030000 date cited in a recent United States intelligence report.
The Iranian government has dismissed the allegations in the intelligence presented to the International Atomic Energy Agency Board as baseless and the intelligence used to support the allegations as fake.
The International Atomic Energy Agency insists that the Iranian government's simple denials of the Intelligence presented to the International Atomic Energy Agency Board are not good enough to allay Western countries suspicions.
Mohammed ElBaradei stated that Iran continues to maintain that these alleged weaponization studies are related to conventional weapons only or are fabricated and that a complete examination of the issue of the these allged weaponization studies has not commenced.
Mohammed ElBaradei stated that it was regrettable that Iran had not suspended Iran's nuclear enrichment activities in line with United Nations Security Council resolutions and was continuing Iran's work on more advanced uranium-enriching centrifuges.
Iranian Ambassador Ali Asghar SOLTANIEH stated the allegations of Iran's covert nuclear weapons program were politically motivated.
Ali Asghar SOLTANIEH stated that the alleged alleged Iranian weaponization studies covered activities that were not strictly nuclear and therefore did not fall under International Atomic Energy Agency jurisdiction.
Ali Asghar SOLTANIEH stated that it is the Iranian government's point of view that all outstanding questions about Iran's nuclear activities had been resolved and the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program proven.
Ali Asghar SOLTANIEH stated that Iran would react to further United Nation's sanctions with measures of Iran's own.
Ali Asghar SOLTANIEH did not specify what actions Iran's measures would consist of.
Ali Asghar SOLTANIEH stated that Iran would continue to cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency despite the additional sanctions.
Mohammad Saeedi stated that any resolution by the United Nations Security Council would complicate and make a resolution of the long-running standoff between the Iranian government and the international community more difficult.
Mohammad Saeedi is the deputy head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation.

Iran warns that new UN resolution against Iran's nuclear program will complicate the nuclear issue.
IAEA meets in Vienna to discuss Iran issue.
20080303 deputy head of the country's atomic energy organization Mohammad Saeedi stated --
A new UN Security Council resolution against Iran's nuclear activities would be irrational and unlawful and complicate the standoff with Western nations rather than promoting resolution of the issue.
The path of the Security Council and any new resolution lacks legal credibility.
Supporters should be held accountable for their illegal act.
20080303 the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) board of governors met in Vienna to discuss the Iranian nuclear issue.
IAEA chief Mohammed ElBaradei demanded that Iran address allegations of involvement in covert nuclear weapons work.
Iran denies seeking atomic weapons and claims that only to endeavor to enrich uranium to lower levels to create nuclear fuel for its rapidly increasing population.
Iran demands the closing of the nuclear case because the most recent IAEA report stated that the Agency had made important progress in a 4-year examination of Iran's nuclear program.
Saeedi stated that reports by IAEA chief Mohammed ElBaradei presented a clear picture of Iran's nuclear program.
The IAEA stated --
The Agency remains unable to confirm the nature of Iran's nuclear program.
Iran continues to defy UN demands to suspend uranium enrichment.
Intelligence presented to the IAEA board the week of 20080225 suggested that Iran was involved in military research indicating non-conventional weapon development.
Iran dismissed the allegations as baseless and the intelligence used to back them as spurious.
Saeedi stated that the Iranian Government has submitted an assessment of the claimed studies and has no remaining commitments in the matter.
Diplomats stated that the IAEA board was considering tabling a resolution pressuring Iran to reveal its disputed nuclear activities.
Iranian Ambassador to the IAEA Ali Asghar SOLTANIEH stated that countries on the board should resist the potential action because there are no suitable grounds for such a resolution.
The UN Security Council planned to increase sanctions on Iran later on 20080303 in an attempt to force Tehran to suspend uranium enrichment that the West fears is aimed at producing a secret nuclear weapon.
Saeedi spoke to the official IRNA news agency in Vienna.

IAEA meeting in Vienna focuses on Iran nuclear issue and possibility of resolution supporting proposed Security Council sanctions on Iran.
20080303 the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)' s 35 member Board of Governors met in Vienna to discuss director general Mohammed ElBaradei's latest report on Iran and the scheduled 1600 GMT UN Security Council vote on new sanctions over Iran's refusal to suspend uranium enrichment.
Diplomats stated --
Depending on the outcome of the Security Council vote, the IAEA board is considering tabling a separate resolution demanding that Iran reveal its disputed nuclear activities.
The IAEA Board does not intend to undermine the primary action of the UN Security Council in New York but a resolution would emphasize the Agency's continued interest in the Iranian nuclear issue.
The IAEA board has not made a resolution in 2 years.
US envoy to the IAEA Gregory Schulte stated to reporters prior to the meeting --
Despite limited progress in addressing past issues, troubling questions remain about Iranian activities that strongly suggest a clandestine weapons-related program.
The Board is likely to support the Security Council's call for Iran to suspend its enrichment-related activities
Indications of weapons work constituting a violation of NPT obligations and Iran's violation of Security Council resolutions provide strong reason for the Security Council and the IAEA to continue to investigate Iran.
ElBaradei's latest report stated --
Iran addressed the majority of outstanding questions about its past nuclear program but refused to address allegations about its purported nuclear weapons work.
Iran is pursuing and expanding uranium enrichment in flagrant violation of UN demands.
Enriched uranium can be used to make the fissile material for an atomic bomb.
The week of 20080225 IAEA governors received detailed intelligence suggesting --
Iran was involved in military research incompatible with conventional weapon activities.
Iran continued nuclear weapons work beyond the 2003 date cited in a recent US intelligence report.
Iran has dismissed the allegations as baseless and the intelligence used to back them as spurious.
20080303 Iranian Ambassador Ali Asghar SOLTANIEH stated to reporters that the alleged weaponization studies covered activities that were not strictly nuclear and therefore did not fall under IAEA jurisdiction.
SOLTANIEH stated that the IAEA's involvement with the allegations was politically motivated.
ElBaradei stated in the opening address to the IAEA board --
Addressing the allegations is necessary to enable the Agency to determine the nature and scope of all of Iran's past nuclear activities.
Iran should be as active and as cooperative as possible in working with the IAEA to clarify this matter of serious concern.
Other items on the agenda for the potentially week-long IAEA meeting include the stalled North Korean disarmament process.

Iran Criticizes UN Security Council for imposing sanctions against Iran's nuclear program in order to appease Western countries.
20080304 Iranian Ambassador to the United Nations Mohammad khazaie stated to the official IRNA news agency --
UN Security Council sanctions over the Iranian nuclear program reveal that the Security Council has been manipulated to implement the foreign policy of Western countries and undermine the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
The resolution is illegitimate and illegal.
20080303 the UN Security Council imposed the 3rd set of sanctions against Iran in 15 months to castigate Iran's refusal to suspend uranium enrichment potentially used to create nuclear weapons.
Britain introduced the sanctions with resolution 1803 and subsequently delayed the vote in order to obtain unanimous approval and increase the impact of the message.
14 of the council's 15 members voted in favor of the resolution, including initial dissidents Libya, South Africa and Vietnam.
Indonesia abstained.
Provisions of the resolution --
Iran must comply with UN and IAEA demands to suspend uranium enrichment within 3 months.
Officials involved in Iran's nuclear and missile programs are banned from travel.
Additional individuals and entities are subject to an assets freeze.
Shipments to and from Iran suspected of containing prohibited goods must be inspected.
States are encouraged to exercise vigilance in entering new commitments for public-provided financial support for trade with Iran, including the granting of export credits.
Reaction to the resolution from Iran was limited.
President Mahmoud ahmadinejad has stated that previous resolutions are inconsequential and the sanctions will have no impact on Iran's nuclear program.
By 1100 GMT on 20080304 no Tehran-based top Iranian official had given a reaction to the resolution.
The resolution received low-profile coverage on state television and was absent from leading news headlines.
State radio emphasized Indonesia's abstention as a defeat for the US.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert stated that Israel possesses the necessary power to defend itself against any threat from Iran.
Iranian officials considered the International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA's latest report a success for Iran despite the Agency's inability to confirm that the nuclear program was peaceful.
Iran hoped that the nuclear case would be removed from the Security Council if the government continued to cooperate with the IAEA to answer questions about past ambiguities in its atomic program.
Iranian Ambassador to the IAEA Ali Asghar SOLTANIEH stated to the ISNA news agency that Western countries in the Security Council intend to damage the efforts of the IAEA.
Intelligence presented to the IAEA Board suggested --
Iran is involved in military research indicating the development of non-conventional weapons.
Iran continued nuclear weapons work beyond the 2003 date cited in a recent US intelligence report.
The Iranian government stated --
The Iranian nuclear program remains peaceful.
The documents presented to the IAEA are fraudulent.
IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei stated to the 35 members of the IAEA's board of governors in Vienna that Iran should be as active and cooperative as possible in working with the agency to clarify the seriously concerning matter of the alleged intelligence.
The 6 world powers issued a statement following the UN vote requesting further talks between EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana and top Iranian nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili to resolve the deadlock.
The head of the Iranian parliament's foreign policy commission Alaeddin Boroujerdi stated that Iran's Supreme National Security Council should react to the resolution with a new decision concerning negotiation with the EU.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel WARNS AGAINST forming energy ties with Iran.
Switzerland signed a gas deal with Iran citing the need for Europe to diversity the continent's oil providers.

On 080521 Japan passed a new law allowing the use of space programs for defense.
An official stated that on 080521 Japan passed a new law allowing the use of space programs for defense and reversed a decades-old policy amid increasing concern about military threats in the region of Japan.
Experts stated that Japan has no current plans for a new defence project in space and that the new law could make it possible for Japan to launch early-warning satellites.
The new law states that the use and development of space should be done in accordance with the pacifist spirit of the Japanese Constitution and benefit the security of Japan and the international community.
The new law attempts to remove any legal obstacles to building more advanced spy satellites and to help innovation in Japans's space industry.
The new law comes amid growing concerns in Japan about North Korea's ballistic missile development and China's military and space programs.
A Japanese government upper house official stated that the Japanese government's opposition-controlled upper house voted 221 to 14 to revise a 690000 parliamentary resolution limiting Japan's use of space to non-military applications.
The bill proposing the new law allowing the use of space programs for defense was already approved by the lower house of Japan's government last week.
The opposition Japanese Communist Party was against the new law and feared it would lead to a stronger military.
Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobutaka Machimura dismissed concerns that the new law could mean that Japan's defence capabilities could exceed the constitutional limits.
Kyodo News reported that the top Japanese government spokesman stated in a press conference that it would be ridiculous would think that Japan would try to invade another country by using satellites and that it is impossible for Japan to invade another country by using satellites.
Proponents of the new law allowing the use of space programs for defense in Japan state that the new law is necessary because Japan has fallen behind other nations in space technology and China is attempting to capture space business in Asia, Africa and Latin America.
Japan's US-imposed post-World War II constitution states that Japan will never again wage war.
Japanese troops have not wage war since 450000.
Japan has one of the world's largest defence budgets.
Japan has stepped up military research after North Korea surprised the world in 980000 by firing a missile over the Japanese mainland into the Pacific Ocean.
China also alarmed Japan in 070000 by conducting a test to shoot down a satellite.
Japan has been increasing the Japanese space program and is currently conducting the most extensive probe of the Moon since the United States Apollo missions of the decades of 600000 and 700000.

Possibility of a global agreement to outlaw cluster bombs were given impetus as British prime minister Gordon Brown called for a total ban on the use of the weapons by the British military.
Hopes for a global agreement to outlaw cluster bombs were given a boost on 080522 when British Prime Minister Gordon Brown called for a total ban on the use of the weapons by the British military.
The statement from Brown's spokesman gave new impetus to ongoing negotiations at an international conference on cluster bombs in Dublin.
Brown's spokesman said Brown had issued instructions to British negotiators in Dublin to work intensively to ban cluster bombs that cause unacceptable harm to civilians.
A British government spokesman said Brown had also asked the Ministry of Defence to assess the remaining munitions in use to ensure that there was no risk to civilians.
The new stance by the British government received a warm welcome from human rights activists and charities.
Head of arms control for Oxfam Anna MacDonald said Britain has at last come in from the cold.
Oxfam hopes that this strong statement from Brown will ensure that the UK signs onto the treaty and immediately gets rid of these weapons which maim and kill long after they have been dropped.
Co-Chair of the cluster munition coalition and Director of Landmine Action Simon Conway expressed gladness that Brown is following up on his previous public commitment to ban cluster bombs.
The Dublin Conference runs until May 30 and is aiming to strike a wide-ranging international agreement that would completely eradicate the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions among signatories.
The United States Government on 080521 expressed opposition to a worldwide ban on cluster bombs and called instead for technological fixes that would make them safer.
Cluster bombs were first used in World War II and open in the air and scatter smaller bombs over a wide area.
The fact that many fail to detonate on impact have made them a risk to the lives of civilians for years.
The British military currently possesses 2 Types of cluster ammunition which are the artillery-fired m85 and the m73 launched from helicopters.
Campaigners claim British troops used the m85 bombs in the Iraq war in 030000.

Ban stated --
10s of 1000s of nuclear weapons remain deployed and stockpiled.
Significant irreversible and verifiable reductions are necessary.
Nuclear proliferation by States or non-State actors threatens everyone and therefore requires global cooperation in addressing non-compliance, resolving concerns over nuclear programs and ensuring the most reliable controls over nuclear materials.
Ban is currently on an Asian tour.
The NPT is the most universal arms control treaty in force.
The NPT was opened for signature on 01 July 1968 and made effective on 05 March 1970.

Amnesty International reports on light weapons impact and urges global arms treaty preventing weapons sales to human rights violators.
20080917 in the report' blood at the crossroads' Amnesty International stated that a new UN global arms treaty under negotiation should require Governments to actively prevent sales of weapons likely to be used in humans rights violations.
The report stated that the system of national laws regulating arms sales is ineffective and enables Unrestrained Weapons trading leading to violations of human rights.
153 countries voted for a UN motion to introduce a global arms treaty in 20061200 and UN member states will discuss progress on the Treaty in 20081000.
Amnesty International stated that the US -- which rejected the arms treaty motion -- China, Egypt, India, Pakistan and Russia are stalling the treaty.
Amnesty arms control manager Brian Wood stated that a minority of skeptics preferring to ignore irresponsible arms transfers defy the majority of the international community's approval of arms control and render most national arms controls and UN arms embargoes weak and ineffective.
The report catalogues the impact of light weapons in 9 countries.
The report states that small weapons were used with catastrophic effects by the Myanmar military to disperse protestors in 20070900 and Somalian armed factions in Mogadishu.
The report also profiles Darfur, Colombia, Guatemala, Guinea and especially Iraq.
The report stated --
The US Department of Defense has funded the majority of over 1 million rifles, pistols and infantry weapons for 530000 Iraqi security personnel since 2003.
The funding process was mismanaged and unaccountable because the contracting out of the weapons deals rendered accurate documentation of supplies and recipients by people authorizing weapons and munitions transfers virtually impossible.
The mismanagement has augmented sectarian violence in Iraq since the 2003 US-led invasion.
Researcher Helen Hughes stated that Governments must meet their obligation through an arms trade treaty with a stipulation on human rights rather than ignoring the consequences of irresponsible international arms transfers.

The leaders of Australia and Japan launched a Commission on September 26, 2008 to press for nuclear Non Proliferation and Disarmament ahead of review of a key international atomic treaty.
The International Commission on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament was unveiled by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and new Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.
The Panel is led by former Australian and Japanese foreign ministers Gareth Evans and Yoriko Kawaguchi respectively and has 15-members.
It is comprised of former heads of State, ministers, military strategists and disarmament experts.
Rudd said it will seek to shape a global consensus in the lead up to the 2010 nuclear Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference and beyond.
Rudd said the NPT is facing increased pressure from the actions of countries such as North Korea and Iran even though NPT is the most significant and successful arms control instrument of the nuclear age and the cornerstone of global disarmament efforts.
Iran has been accused of carrying out an illegal nuclear program while North Korea has defiantly moved to restart its illicit nuclear activities after stopping them.
Aso said Japan has always undertaken a realistic and concrete approach towards realizing a nuclear weapons free world because it is the only country that experienced the bombing of a nuclear weapon.
Aso assumed the premiership this week.
Aso told the Commission to hold active discussions and prepare meaningful recommendations for a more effective non-proliferation and disarmament regime.
A statement said the implications of a likely nuclear renaissance due to climate change and energy security concerns will be a focus of the Commission.
This includes the need for renewed attention to nuclear safeguards, safety and security.
The first meeting of the Commission will be held in Sydney from October 19 to 21.
It will be hosted by the Australian Government.
Among those in the Commission are former Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo, former US Defense Secretary William Perry, ex-Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, China's ex-UN envoy Wang Yingfan.

Archbishop Desmond Tutu makes appeal at UN for member states to support a global arms trade treaty to stop the casualties worldwide which result from the uncontrolled small arms trade.
South Africa's retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu on 081021 appealed to UN member states to end the casualties which result from the uncontrolled small arms trade by backing a global arms trade treaty.
Tutu's appeal came as the UN Disarmament Committee is set to vote on an arms trade treaty (Att) resolution next week.
Some 85 countries are co-sponsoring the text.
Tutu pointed out in a message delivered to all 192 missions at the United Nations in New York that in the last 2 years almost 0.75 million people have died as a result of armed violence.
Tutu said each Member State can and must act to control the deadly trade in weapons that is behind these deaths.
Tutu said there can be no further delay and that is time to end the slaughter.
Tutu said there are some States which are opposed to such a treaty and will seek to undermine and delay any further progress or will seek to convince others that this Treaty is not required or cannot work.
Tutu said these States must not be allowed to succeed because the human cost is too high.
Tutu's message was delivered by activists of the control arms campaign.
The control arms campaign is pushing for a strong treaty to stop the sales of small arms around the world and was launched 5 years ago by Amnesty International, Oxfam International and the International Action Network on Small Arms.
The UN General Assembly in 061200 overwhelmingly adopted a resolution launching a process for a treaty to prevent arms transfers that fuel conflicts and serious human rights violations around the world.
Only the United States voted against.
24 Governments abstained.
That resolution asked then-UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to seek the views of Member States on the feasibility, scope and draft parameters for a comprehensive and legally binding instrument establishing common international standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional arms.

Denmark's foreign intelligence admitted that claims made in 2003 that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction were incorrect, yet Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen stated that weapons of mass destruction were not the reason Denmark entered the war in Iraq.
On 4 November 2008 in an address to the Danish parliamentary Defense Commission Danish Foreign Intelligence Service (FE) stated --
claims made in 2003 that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction were incorrect.
Fe's work was careless.
Fe's information was not based on credible sources.
Fe's information sources were poor and insufficient.
Fe concluded wrongly that Iraq most likely had weapons of mass destruction (WMD).
The intelligence services of all other nations concluded wrongly that Iraq most likely had WMD.
It was difficult for western intelligence agencies to operate under Saddam's regime.
few Iraqis were able to be recruited as informants under Saddam's regime.
Iraqis recruited as spies turned out to be weak sources.
Last week Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen defended Danish involvement in the Iraq war.
Rasmussen stated --
Politicians widely believed that Saddam Hussein kept WMD and other chemical and biological weapons.
WMD were not the official reason for Denmark entering the war in Iraq.
Denmark entered the war in Iraq because Saddam refused to cooperate with United Nations.
A majority of lawmakers in the Danish Parliament approved military action.
Defense spokesman for the opposition Social Democrat Party John dyrby paulsen told Danish television that --
Rasmussen claimed Saddam Hussein did not cooperate with the UN only because he knew that the WMD argument would not be believed.

A statement released by the French foreign ministry said the European Union expressed strong concern on November 7, 2008 over Russia's decision to deploy missiles on the EU's enclave of Kaliningrad.
Russian president Dmitry Medvedev made a statement about the deployment of Iskander short-range missiles in the western Russian territory on November 5, 2008.
An EU statement said Medvedev's statement does not contribute to creating a climate of confidence and to improving security in Europe.
The statement said the Presidency of the European Union Council expresses its strong concern following the statement by President Medvedev.
It announced the deployment of the Iskander missiles in the Kaliningrad region.
The EU said they regret Russia's move.
The EU wanted a dialogue with Russia on questions surrounding the security of the entire European continent and Russia has made proposals on the matter.
Medvedev said the deployment would counter a U.S. anti-missile system to be based in Poland and the Czech Republic by 2013-2014.
Russia would shoot a warning shot to U.S. president-elect Barack Obama and the United State's allies in Central Europe.
NATO has voiced serious worries about the arms control implications of the Russian plans.
The United States has described them as disappointing.
EU foreign ministers meet on November 10, 2008 to debate whether to resume partnership talks with Russia before the EU-Russia summit in Nice, southern France on November 14, 2008.

President Oscar Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica called for a global reduction of military spending as a matter of international security on November 19, 2008.
Costa Rica is an unarmed state.
Arias in an address before the UN Security Council said the logic that leads a poor nation to spend excessive sums on its armies and not on its people is perverse and is the antithesis of human security.
It is a serious threat to international security.
Costa Rica presides over the UN Security Council this month.
Arias said Costa Rica is not a naive nation even though it has no military.
Arias is a 1987 novel Peace Prize laureate.
Arias said Costa Rica has not come for the abolition of all armies.
Costa Rica has not come to discuss reduction of world military spending which has reached 3.3 billion dollars a day.
Costa Rica proposed instead that a gradual reduction is not only possible but also imperative particularly for developing nations.
The Costa Rican President decried the limited application of article 26 of the UN Charter.
It calls on the Security Council to use international arms control to avoid diverting human and economic resources.
Arias said article 26 has been a dead letter in the vast cemetery of intentions for world peace until now.
Arias is promoting stronger multi-lateralism.
Arias said nations will continue to arm themselves at the expense of the people's development and international security as long as the nations do not feel protected by strong regional organizations with real powers to act.
This is particularly true in the poorest countries.
Arias urged the Security Council to apply the Costa Rica consensus.
The consensus forgives debts and provides aid for developing countries that spend more on human resources than the military.
Arias pressed the international body to support the arms trade treaty.
The Treaty would control International arms sales to prevent the illicit use of weapons.
Arias said the 640 million small arms and light weapons that exist in the world has proven to be more lethal than nuclear weapons and is one of the primary threats to national and international security.
74 percent of the small arms and light weapons are owned by civilians.

The Chosun Ilbo newspaper report stated that the South Korean Foreign Ministry stated that becoming a full member of the Proliferation Security Initiative would be helpful in strengthening South Korea's alliance with the United States.
The South Korean Foreign Ministry Spokesman Cho Hee-Yong also declined to confirm that the South Korean Foreign Ministry had made the proposal suggesting that South Korea should consider becoming a full member of the Proliferation Security Initiative.
In a 1 sentence statement issued later in the day on 080112 Cho Hee-Yong stated that there is no change in the South Korean government's basic position that we support the purpose and principle of the Proliferation Security Initiative and South Korea will adjust the scope of South Korea's participation according to South Korea's judgment.
Park Jung-Ha stated without any further elaboration to the Associated Press that the incoming South Korean government have not discussed the Proliferation Security Initiative at all.
Park Jung-ha is a transition team spokesman.
The North Korean government has warned the South Korean government against participating in the Proliferation Security Initiative program.
The North Korean government stated if the South Korean government participates in the proliferation security initiative program it would result in unspecified catastrophic consequences.
The Proliferation Security Initiative was launched in 030000 primarily to deter trade in missile and nuclear technology by States such as North Korea and Iran.
Countries participating in the proliferation security initiative hold maritime drills to search ships suspected of carrying nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, materials to make these weapons, or missiles to deliver these weapons.
South Korea has only been an observer to the Proliferation Security Initiative Program and the South Korean government has so far refused United States requests to become a full member of the Proliferation Security Initiative program.
The South Korean government has stated that South Korea does not want to provoke North Korea.
North Korea views the Proliferation Security Initiative program as a United States attempt to overthrow the Communist regime in North Korea.
The South Korea is led by a liberal government.
Lee Myung-bak has stated that he would strengthen relations with the United States because the United States and South Korea lacked trust under the outgoing South Korean administration.
Lee Myung-Bak is a conservative former Seoul mayor.
Lee Myung-Bak will take take the Office of the President of South Korea on 080225.

The Brazilian Government is seeking to buy military technology from France that could help Brazil build a nuclear submarine.
It also wants to establish a strategic partnership with France involving exchange of experiences and knowledge and hopes to discuss deals involving France's Rafale fighter jet and the Cougar cargo helicopter.
Brazil's Defense Ministry said 080128 that the Brazilian Government is seeking to buy military technology from France that could help Brazil become the first country in Latin America to have a nuclear submarine.
Defense ministry spokesman Jose Ramos said Defense Minister Nelson Jobim traveled to France during 080120-080126 with the main objective of the visit being to discuss the possible purchase of a diesel-powered Scorpene class submarine that would serve as a model for the development of a nuclear submarine.
Ramos said that any defense-related agreement that may eventually be signed with the Government of France must include the transfer of technology and noted that Brazil has nuclear reactors and fuel enrichment capacity but has not had the technology to build a nuclear submarine.
Ramos declined to confirm a report published 080128 by the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper saying that the Brazilian Government would buy the submarine for US $600 million and pay off the amount over 20 years at an annual interest rate of 2.4 percent.
The Brazilian Government has discussed building a nuclear submarine for decades and began a formal program in 1979.
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva announced US $540 million in new funding for the program and for existing uranium enrichment efforts in 070700.
Executive Director of Washington-based nonpartisan research group Arms Control Association Daryl Kimball said that Brazil will surely become the first country in Latin America to have a nuclear submarine if a Brazil-France agreement results in the construction of a nuclear submarine.
Other topics of Jobim's visit to France:
Ramos said the Brazilian government wants to establish a strategic partnership with France which would involve the exchange of experiences and knowledge and noted that France is interested in Brazilian jungle warfare knowledge in terms of both tactics and the use of electronic equipment in the humidity of tropical rain forests.
Ramos said that the Brazilian government also hopes to discuss deals involving France's Rafale fighter jet and the Cougar cargo helicopter but gave no additional details.

International Atomic Energy Agency director ElBaradei says the biggest danger facing the world is not new nuclear States but the risk of extremist groups obtaining atomic weapons.
Director General of the UN International Atomic Energy Agency Mohammed ElBaradei told a conference of the world's top defense officials on 080209 that the biggest danger facing the world is not new nuclear States but the risk of extremist groups obtaining atomic weapons.
ElBaradei urged a reduction of the world's nuclear stockpile and better controls and said that an extremist group would use nuclear weapons upon procuring such weapons.
ElBaradei said that even countries which have nuclear weapons know that a country which uses nuclear weapons will be pulverized but that extremist groups will use nuclear weapons if possible.
ElBaradei said that countries need to be aware that extremist groups procuring nuclear weapons is the number one security threat the world is facing and added as a note of caution that given the state of the system of international controls it was hard to determine whether nuclear materials were ending up with extremist groups.
ElBaradei said much of the material that is reported stolen is never recovered and that a lot of the material recovered has never been reported stolen.
ElBaradei said in reference to Iran that the international community should quickly engage in talks with the Iranian government to secure guarantees that the Iranian nuclear program will not be used to develop weapons and that such confidence can only be built through direct negotiations.
U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman said that Iran remained the world's top arms control challenge and that it would be a profound mistake to focus on the recent U.S. national intelligence estimate that suggested Iran no longer had a nuclear weapons program.
Lieberman pointed out that in the Nie report which said that the Iranian government's covert work on bomb design may have been temporarily suspended in 03000 it was also and far more importantly stated that Iran's overt work on enrichment continues apace.
German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier similarly emphasized that the Nie report in no way grants Iran any kind of absolution.
Germany has been working with the 5 permanent U.N. Security Council members on the Iranian nuclear issue.
Steinmeier consequently believes it is right for the international community to keep up the pressure on Iran.
Steinmeier said that in the interests of global safety the international community's common goals must continue to be to prevent Iranian nuclear armament and to counteract the erosion of the Nonproliferation Treaty.

The Vienna Forum which ends on February 15, 2008 has revealed that organ trafficking is becoming a prominent issue.
Among one of the conclusions from the Vienna Forum is that top transplant surgeons are involved in the trade.
An expert stated on February 14, 2008 that top transplant surgeons in Austria are collaborating with criminal organ trafficking networks to target desperate people.
During the Vienna Forum to fight human trafficking Nancy scheper-Hughes stated that organ trafficking involves people from the highest levels of professions.
Nancy scheper-Hughes also stated that some surgeons are willing to collaborate with the key factors of the organ trade including criminal networks, brokers and kidney hunters.
Recently a man in India was accused of being the leader of a syndicate that is alleged to have illegally removed hundreds of kidney including some from poor laborers held at gunpoint.
Indian police stated that the man headed an illegal organ transplant ring based in the upscale New Delhi suburb of gurgao.
The syndicate may have sold up to 500 kidneys to clients who traveled to India from around the world in the past 9 years.
Nancy schepeter-Hughes stated that no accurate estimate of how many people are trafficked for organs exists but a conservative estimate would be 15000 trafficked kidneys per year.
Nancy schepeter-Hughes stated that there strong cases documenting coercion in Eastern Europe, Turkey, Israel, India and the United States.
Nancy schepeter-Hughes stated that most victims of kidney trafficking are coerced by need and not by physical force.
In Brazil people were competing to be chosen for kidney trafficking.
Individuals stuffed 10 dollar bills into the pocket of a kidney broker.
Nancy schepeter-Hughes stated that this competition is driven by desperation.
Nancy schepeter-Hughes stated that trafficking does not have to be transnational and can also be found within countries.
A December 2007 World Health Organization Bulletin included a paper that noted that the shortage of an indigenous supply of organs has led to the development of the international organ trade.
Yosuke shimazono wrote the paper.
The paper also noted that the international organ trade is not well understood because of a lack of data and lack of effort to integrate the available information.
The Vienna Forum ends on February 15, 2008 and is being convened by the United Nations global initiative to fight human trafficking.
Nancy scheper-Hughes is Founding Director of organs Watch, a professor, and the Director of University of California at Berkeley's medical anthropology program.

The United Kingdom's Foreign Office released an early version of a 020000 dossier of prewar intelligence on Iraq that became vital to Tony Blair's case for going to war in Iraq.
On 080218 the United Kingdom's Foreign Office released an early version of a 020000 dossier of prewar intelligence on Iraq that became vital to Tony Blair's case for going to war in Iraq.
Foreign Secretary David Miliband published a draft of the dossier on Iraq's weapons capabilities following a request under freedom of information laws.
The dossier of prewar intelligence on Iraq includes references to intelligence claims that Iraq had acquired uranium and had equipment necessary to produce chemical weapons.
The dossier of prewar intelligence on Iraq does not contain a claim that Iraq could launch weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes.
The claim that Iraq could launch weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes was an allegation that became crucial to Blair's support of the 030000 United States led invasion of Iraq and the allegation was later discredited.
Freedom of Information campaigners allege the assertion that that Iraq could launch weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes was inserted into later drafts of the dossier of prewar intelligence shortly before the dossier was published on the orders of Tony Blair's office in order to strengthen the case for war in Iraq.
The Freedom of Information campaigners allegations is strongly denied by Government of the United Kingdom.
David Miliband stated that the early draft of dossier of prewar intelligence on Iraq was not used as the basis for later documents that were drafted by the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The early draft of dossier of prewar intelligence on Iraq was produced by then Foreign Office press office chief John Williams.
Tony Blair presented a final draft of the joint intelligence committee dossier to the United Kingdom's Parliament on 020924.
The final draft of the joint intelligence committee dossier included the claim that Iraq could launch weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes.
The name of the joint intelligence committee dossier was Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
A second document was published in 030200 was found to have repeated verbatim parts of an academic study on Iraq's supposed concealment of weapons of mass destruction.
The second document that was published in 030200 became known as the dodgy dossier.
Hans Blix stated in 070000 that Hans Blix believed that Tony Blair had replaced question marks with exclamation marks in intelligence dossiers to justify the decision to invade Iraq.
Hans Blix is the former United Nations chief weapons inspector.
Lord Butler's 2004 official inquiry into the intelligence on Iraq did not fault Tony Blair's government.
Lord Butler's 2004 official inquiry criticized intelligence officials for relying in part on seriously flawed or unreliable sources.
Lord Butler stated that the dossiers had pushed the Government of the United Kingdom's case to the limits of available intelligence and left out vital caveats.
United Kingdom's government weapons scientist David Kelly killed himself in 030000 after he was exposed as the source of a British Broadcasting Corporation report that accused Tony Blair's Downing Street office of embellishing intelligence to make a stronger case for war in Iraq.
On 080218 John Williams stated in The Guardian newspaper that many within United Kingdom's government had failed to find problems with Tony Blair's case for joining the invasion of Iraq.
The 080218 statement in the Guardian newspaper was written by John Williams.
On 080218 John Williams stated in The Guardian newspaper that other people were more perceptive than the many within United Kingdom's government had failed to find problems with Tony Blair's case for joining the invasion of Iraq and that one of these more perceptive people was the former United Kingdom Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
Robin Cook was one of the ministers John Williams advised for a time.
David Miliband criticized the decision of freedom of information authorities to order the release of the John Williams document.
David Miliband stated in writing that officials and other people who draft policy documents should not feel constrained in presenting free and frank advice through fear that their ideas will be made public.
Robin Cook resigned from Tony Blair's cabinet in opposition to the Iraq war because Robin Cook claimed he could not support military action without international approval.
Robin cook died in 050000.
John Williams wrote in The Guardian newspaper on 080218 that Robin Cook was right and the people who carried on working for the Government of the United Kingdom were wrong.
David Miliband criticized the decision of freedom of information authorities to order the release of John Williams written statement.

Colombia's Vice President Francisco Santos stated to the world disarmament body on March 4, 2008 that police found computer evidence indicating Colombia's main leftist rebel group called the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia had been trying to obtain radioactive material for dirty bombs to threaten Latin America.
Francisco Santos stated that Colombian police found the evidence on two computers discovered with Raul Reyes.
The Conference on Disarmament contains 65 members.
Francisco Santos stated that Colombia will readily provide the Committee with any information requested on the topic of the connection between drug trafficking and terrorist groups.
Colombian security forces killed Raul Reyes on March 1, 2008 in Ecuador.
Raul Reyes is second in command of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia and was the public face of the group as well as the group's spokesman.
Colombia stated on March 3, 2008 that the country found computer documents suggesting the rebels have bought and sold uranium.
Francisco Santos stated that the development demonstrates that the economic power of drug trafficking is enabling terrorist groups to constitute a serious threat not only to Colombia but to the entire Andean and Latin American region.
Uranium is a radioactive material which is the primary basis for generating dirty weapons of mass destruction and terrorism.

Colombia is worried about rebel plan involving obtaining uranium but has no evidence of plot for dirty bomb.
The Colombian government is worried about documents on the laptop of a slain rebel leader indicating the guerrillas were trying to obtain uranium.
Colombian Vice President Francisco Santos had told the 65-member Conference on Disarmament on 080304 that the Colombian Government was alarmed because uranium is the primary basis for generating dirty weapons of mass destruction and for terrorism.
Santos backed off slightly and told the Associated Press on 080305 that Colombian authorities have no evidence or indication that the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia are seeking to use the uranium to build a radioactive dirty bomb.
Santos said in a telephone interview from Brussels that what Santos had meant was to take note and not take it lightly and said that putting the FARC rebels and the word uranium in the same sentence was alarming.
The FBI has an office in Bogota and Spokesman Richard kolko said in Washington that the FBI has no information or intelligence regarding the FARC attempting to use weapons of mass destruction.
The FARC has been fighting successive Colombian Governments for more than 4 decades using conventional weapons.
The document addressing uranium was found in a laptop belonging to a top FARC commander named Raul Reyes.
Reyes was killed on 080301 in a raid into Ecuador that has generated intense international criticism.
The poorly written communication addressed to Reyes was dated 080216 and was signed by Edgar Tovar.
Santos said Tovar commands a FARC front near Ecuador.
Tovar wrote that a man named Belisario in Bogota supplies Tovar with explosives and sent Tovar a catalog and specifications.
Tovar wrote that Belisario proposed to sell each kilo at US $2.5 million and deliver it and that Tovar and Reyes would then find a buyer.
Tovar wrote the deal would be with a Government and to sell them a sizable amount.
Tovar wrote Belisario had 50 kilos ready and could sell a lot more as Belisario had direct contact with uranium suppliers.
The uranium reference in Tovar's writing was quickly cited by Colombia's government while seeking to deflect criticism over the raid.
Gen. Oscar Naranjo said at an explosive news conference that the FARC mentioning negotiations for 50 kilos of uranium means that the FARC are taking big steps in the world of terrorism to become a global aggressor and were not just domestic guerrillas but transnational terrorists.
Santos took Colombia's complaints to the European Union's foreign affairs representative Javier Solano on 080305.
Santos told the AP after meeting with Solano that the Europeans were really worried about the uranium and were not taking the issue lightly.
Colombian officials say they have no other information from the laptop or other sources indicating FARC interest in radioactive materials or unconventional weapons.
It wasn't clear what exactly the material Tovar was writing about might be.
Santos said the uranium mentioned in the communication sounded like processed uranium.
The price mentioned suggests that the uranium would be processed and hence dangerous.
Charles Ferguson is a physicist with the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington and said that unprocessed uranium is relatively harmless and goes for about US $100 a kilo.
Ferguson expressed fear if the uranium in question were the highly enriched weapons-grade uranium capable of being used in a low-yield improvised nuclear device.
Ferguson was not aware of any highly enriched uranium of appreciable quantities in the region near Colombia and Venezuela.

An appeals court in Vietnam has sentenced an Australian woman to death for heroin trafficking overturning her original sentence of life imprisonment.
The Vietnam-born woman apprehended at the Ho Chi Minh City Airport states she was hired by an unidentified man to ship the heroin to Australia.
On 19 March 2008 a court official stated that an appeals court in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam has sentenced an Australian woman to death for heroin trafficking.
The anonymous court official stated that at the 1-day trial on 18 March 2008 Vietnam-born Jasmine Luong of Sydney, Australia was convicted of trafficking 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) of heroin.
The court official cited Vietnamese policy for speaking under condition of anonymity.

Luong was sentenced to death for involvement in a heroin trafficking ring.
The British embassy said in a statement released on 4 April 2008 that Vietnam's President Nguyen Minh triet commuted the death sentence for Vietnamese-born British citizen Le Manh Luong to life in prison.
Luong and 3 other Vietnamese defendants were sentenced in 2006 to death for involvement in a drug ring that trafficked 339 kilograms (746 pounds) of heroin from Laos to Hong Kong and China via Vietnam.
An appeals court in 2007 upheld the death sentences.
The embassy stated President triet commuted Luong's sentence in March 2008 after several British Government appeals to spare Luong from the firing squad.
The embassy stated the British government is opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances.
It is the Government's policy to make representations at any stage and level deemed appropriate when a British national faces the death penalty.
Vietnam's drug laws are among the world's strictest laws.

A parliamentary commission report said on April 9, 2008 that money from drug trafficking in Bulgaria has been used to fund terrorist groups.
A parliamentary commission report stated on April 9, 2008 that money from drug trafficking in Bulgaria has been used to fund terrorist groups.
The report said Bulgarian crime groups engaged in trafficking and drugs sometimes work together with Arab citizens linked to terrorist organizations.
The Associated Press obtained a copy of the document.
The report said that part of the profit from trafficking in drugs such as amphetamines has been used to finance terrorist organizations like Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad, and Christian militias in Lebanon.
The U.S. State Department said in its 2008 international narcotics control strategy report that Bulgaria continues to be a source of drug production.
Part of that is being smuggled into Turkey and the Middle East.
The parliamentary report was issued amid revelations of illegal links between senior police officers and criminals.
The document said the amount of illegal drugs seized by authorities declined after classified police information had been leaked to criminals.
The leaks prompted the arrest of senior police and a motion of no-confidence from opposition parties.
The document is based on figures from the National Security Agency.
The motion will be voted on April 11, 2008.
Bulgaria's government has been repeatedly criticized by the European Union over its inability to tackle rampant corruption and organized crime.
Bulgaria's government is a Socialist-led coalition.
Bulgaria is a Balkan country of 7.7 million people and lies on a major drug trafficking route linking Western Europe, the Middle East and southwestern Asia.

25 members of the Muslim Brotherhood were convicted and sentenced to jail time while 15 members were acquitted.
The charges against members of the Muslim Brotherhood included money laundering and terrorism.
A security official stated that on 15 April 2008 an Egyptian military court known for severe verdicts convicted 25 key members of the opposition Muslim Brotherhood with sentences up to 10 years in jail.
The security official attended the trial at the court north of Cairo but spoke on condition of anonymity because the official is not authorized to speak to the media.
The official stated the charges against members of Egypt's largest opposition group included money laundering and terrorism but it was not immediately clear if the 25 were found guilty of both offenses.
The official stated that 15 other defendants were acquitted.
Among the acquitted were businessman Abdel-Rahman Saudi who runs a supermarket chain in Egypt and a journalist.
Authorities created a security ring around the courthouse with 100s of policemen creating checkpoints on the road leading to the court before the verdict announcement.
Police searched vehicles and drove away reporters and family members of the defendants.
A security official stated that approximately 20 people including relatives and reporters were detained.
Defense lawyer Abdel-Moneim Abdel-Maksoud stated the judge entered the courtroom and issued the ruling but then left without notifying the opposition group's defense lawyers who stood outside the courthouse after being prevented by policemen from entering the courtroom.
The 25 sentenced included the Brotherhood's chief strategist Khayrat El-Shater and the Brotherhood's prominent financier and businessman Hassan Malek.
El-Shater joined the Brotherhood in 1974 and has been jailed 4 times for a total of 7 years on charges relating to membership in the Brotherhood which was outlawed before 1958.
Malek owns a chain of furniture stores and textile factories and is known as 1 of the Brotherhood's main financiers.
El-Shater and Malek each received 7-year sentences.
El-Shater and Malek's property was confiscated and is believed to be worth millions of dollars.
Abdel-Maksoud stated the confiscation will affect the Brotherhood's financial bases.
Abdel-Maksoud stated that a recent amendment to the Egyptian judicial system allows defendants to appeal within 60 days.
The 25 people sentenced have been in custody since December 2006.
The arrests were believed to have been sparked by a militia-style demonstration by student Brotherhood members from the Al-Azhar University in Cairo.
The demonstrators wore black and masks similar to those of the militant Palestinian Hamas and Lebanon's Hezbollah groups.
The demonstration prompted a government investigation into whether the Brotherhood had resurrected a military wing.
The Brotherhood figures were referred to a military court after the arrests.
The referral is authorized under emergency laws in effect since 1981 that allow the president to refer civilians to military tribunals.
Brotherhood members have since been routinely tried before military courts but the trial in 2007-2008 is the largest in years.
The verdict in the yearlong trial occurred amid a government crackdown on the Brotherhood and unrest in Egypt over rising food prices and stagnant wages.
More than 800 Brotherhood members have been detained in 2008 in an effort to decrease influence as President Hosni Mubarak enters the 27th year in power.
100s of Brotherhood members and supporters have been detained in Security sweeps since October 2006.
The 40 senior figures on trial were detained as part of the sweeps.
7 senior figures were tried in absentia and are believed to be outside the country.
Some of the 7's whereabouts are unknown.
5 of the absent senior figures received 10-year prison terms including Swiss-based Egyptian-born businessman Youssef M. Nada whose company has been listed by the United States since 2001 as an organization accused of helping fund terrorism.
London-based human rights group Amnesty International called the sentences on 15 April 2008 a perversion of justice and demanded the men be released and retried in a civilian court.
Amnesty International said in a statement that the sentences leave little doubt that the Egyptian authorities are determined to undermine what has become the main opposition group in Egypt.
Amnesty International stated trying civilians before military courts flouts international standards of fair trial and is inherently unjust.
The Muslim Brotherhood's supreme leader Mohammed Mahdi Akef denounced the verdict and stated that Egyptian authorities are corrupt gangsters.
Akef stated to the Associated Press that there was no evidence against the convicted and that acquittals for the convicted are expected.
Akef stated in a telephone interview that gangs not politicians rule Egypt.
Akef would not discuss the Brotherhood's future plans.
The Brotherhood won 88 of parliament's 454 seats in the 2005 elections with Brotherhood candidates running as independents.

South African government officials will not intervene to disallow Chinese arms shipment to Zimbabwe despite volatile political situation following contested presidential election.
South African officials approved transit of the arms shipment to Zimbabwe stating it cannot act unilaterally to prevent a trade deal between 2 countries.
On 17 April 2008 a South African government spokesman stated that South Africa will not intervene to stop a shipment of Chinese-made weapons from reaching Zimbabwe despite the acute instability of the political situation in Zimbabwe.
South African government spokesman Themba Maseko stated that the Zimbabwean government's failure to release election results 2 weeks after elections is cause for great concern and that the dire situation requires mediation.
Maseko's comments were the strongest issued on the subject by the South African Government to date.
South African President Thabo Mbeki is the main mediator in Zimbabwe.
Mbeki has stated that there is no crisis in Zimbabwe despite the increasing violence and intimidation since the 29 March 2008 vote and the refusal of Zimbabwe's election commission to release results that independent observers and the opposition State show President Robert Mugabe lost the vote.
Critics call the South African reaction appeasement.
Criticism increased on 17 April 2008 following a report that South African mediator Sydney Mufamadi led an arms control committee meeting that approved transit of a shipment of Chinese weapons across South African territory en route to Zimbabwe.
The Chinese ship called an Yue Jiang docked in Durban harbor in South Africa after receiving approval from Port authorities late on 16 April 2008.
The Beeld newspaper stated the ship was carrying approximately 3 million rounds of ammunition for small arms and AK-47s, approximately 3500 mortars and mortar launchers and 1500 rockets for rocket-propelled grenades.
The newspaper stated it obtained a copy of the ship's cargo documentation finalized 3 days after Zimbabwe's election on 01 April 2008.
A South African government official speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed the presence of weapons on the ship but gave no further details.
Durban port authorities and police explosives inspectors could not immediately be reached for comment.
Government spokesman Maseko stated that if administrative papers are in order the Government of South Africa cannot intervene to prevent weapons from being transported through its territory to a neighboring landlocked country.
After a cabinet meeting Maseko stated to reporters --
The Government of South Africa cannot act unilaterally to prevent a trade deal between 2 countries.
South Africa is not involved in the arrangement.
It would be possible but very difficult for South Africa to intervene and to disallow the shipment.
There was presently no trade embargo against Zimbabwe.
China is one of Zimbabwe's main trade partners and allies.
A group representing mainly white South Africans called afriforum stated it would organize protests along the route to Zimbabwe.
Afriforum's kallie kriel stated that the National Conventional Arms Control Committee had granted approval for the transit of the weapons on 14 April 2008.
Kriel stated he had written to Committee Chairman and Local Government Minister Sydney Mufamadi asking him to retract the permission.
Kriel stated that the South African Government's approval for the transport of the arms across South African territory effectively means that the government is replacing its ineffective policy of silent diplomacy with a more catastrophic policy of complicity with the State violence and human rights violations committed by the Zimbabwean government against its own citizens.
The South African opposition Democratic Alliance agreed with kriel's comments.
Mufamadi also heads the South African mediating team between Zimbabwe's ruling ZANU-PF party and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change.
Mufamadi's office referred reporters to the Arms Control Committee whose spokesman did not immediately return phone calls.

The South African Government stated on April 4, 2008 that the South African Government will probably not stop the arms shipment head to Zimbabwe.
This decision is controversial because Zimbabwe is currently politically unstable.
A South African government spokesman stated on April 4, 2008 that South Africa will not intervene to stop a shipment of Chinese-made weapons from reaching Zimbabwe even though the political situation in Zimbabwe is dire.
The shipment is in a ship called the an Yue hiang which was anchored outside Durban harbor after receiving permission late on April 16, 2008 to dock.
The shipment contains nearly 3 million rounds of ammunition for small arms and AK-47s, about 3500 mortars and mortar launchers and 1500 rockets for rocket-propelled grenades.
This report comes from the Beeld newspaper which claimed to have a copy of the ship's cargo documentation finalized on April 1, 2008 which was 3 days after Zimbabwe's election.
An anonymous government official confirmed that the shipment contained weapons but gave no further details.
Durban port authorities and police explosives inspectors could not be reached for comment.
The South African Revenue Service said customs officials were bound by confidentiality rules and could not give details of the content of the cargo.
Spokesman Themba Maseko stated as long as administrative papers are in order South Africa cannot intervene to prevent weapons being transported through South African territory to Zimbabwe.
Defense Secretary January Masilela confirmed to South African radio that the National Conventional Arms Control Committee granted approval for the transit of the weapons.
January Masilela stated that if the buyer is the Zimbabwean sovereign government and the seller is the Chinese sovereign government, South Africa has nothing to do with the transaction because South Africa works according to established international conventions which allow the nation no jurisdiction over goods in transit.
Sydney Mufamadi is the government official who approved the transit and he is the same official who heads the team mediating in the Zimbabwe crisis.
Themba Maseko stated that the situation in Zimbabwe is dire because elections are held and results are not released 2 weeks after.
This was the strongest comment on Zimbabwe so far by the South African Government.
On April 17, 2008 Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai called on South Africa and President Thabo Mbeki to step aside as mediator for Zimbabwe in favor of Zambia's president, who has taken a tougher stance toward Mugabe.
Afriforum criticized the decision to approve the arms shipment.
Afriforum is a lobbying group representing mainly white South Africans.
Afriforum stated that the group would organize protests along the route to Zimbabwe.
Kallie kriel of afriforum stated that the South African Government's approval for the transport of the arms across South African territory will in effect mean that the Government is replacing an ineffective policy of silent diplomacy with an even more catastrophic policy of complicity to the State violence and human rights violations committed by the Zimbabwean government against Zimbabwean citizens.
The South African Revenue Service stated that the ship would be subject to standard inspection procedures and the cargo would not be released until ithe cargo was proved to be compliant to customs formalities.
The approval process can be lengthy.

The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution on April 25, 2008 that will keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of terrorists.
The United Nations Security Council is urging increased efforts to keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of terrorist and black marketeers.
A resolution adopted unanimously by the United Nations Council on April 25, 2008 calls on all States to fully implement a 2004 resolution that closed a loophole in global efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
The resolution requires all 192 United Nations Member States to adopt laws to prevent terrorists, black marketeers and other non-State actors from manufacturing, acquiring or trafficking in nuclear, biological or chemical weapons or the materials to make them.
The resolution notes that some unnamed countries have not filed a report on efforts to implement the resolution that was due in October 2004.

The United Nations Security Council unanimously approved a resolution urging increased efforts to keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of terrorists and black marketeers.
On 080425 the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved a resolution urging increased efforts to keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of terrorists and black marketeers.
The Security Council resolution calls on all States to fully implement a Security Council resolution adopted in 040400 requiring all 192 United Nation Member States to adopt laws to prevent non-State actors from acquiring nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.
The Security Council resolution notes that some unnamed countries have not filed a report on the member nations efforts to adopt these laws.
The report was due to the United Nations in 041000.
The 080425 Security Council resolution stresses the need to enhance the coordination of national, regional and international efforts to strengthen a global response to the serious challenge of keeping weapons from terrorists and the threat to international security.
The 040400 Security Council resolution was adopted to close a loophole in global efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
International treaties targeted weapons proliferation by Governments until Resolution 1540 was adopted in 040000 there was no legal instrument to prevent terrorists, criminal scientists, black marketeers and other non-State actors from obtaining weapons of mass destruction.
Resolution 1540 was introduced as the International Atomic Energy Agency was investigating a vast black market in nuclear equipment and technology.
The black market investigation was encouraged by Pakistan's admission in 040200 that Pakistan's leading nuclear scientist had passed technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea.
Pakistan's leading nuclear scientist, was Abdul Qadeer Khan.
Resolution 1540 requires all countries to adopt laws to prevent non-State actors from manufacturing, acquiring or trafficking in nuclear, biological or chemical weapons, the materials to make them, and the missiles and other systems to deliver them.
Resolution 1540 requires all countries to take measures to account for and secure these weapons, missiles and other weapons material.
Resolution 1540 also demands that countries develop border controls and step up law enforcement efforts to detect, deter, prevent and combat the illicit trafficking and brokering of weapons of mass destruction.
All countries were required to submit a report within 6 months to a Security Council committee monitoring implementation of esolution 1540.
The resolution adopted on 080425 extends the Resolution 1540 Committee's mandate until 110425 and again calls upon all States that have not yet presented a first report on steps the States have taken or intend to take to implement Resolution 1540 to submit such a report to the 1540 Committee without delay.
The 080425 resolution emphasizes the importance for all States to fully implement Resolution 1540.
The 080425 resolution also calls on the Resolution 1540 Committee to continue to intensify its efforts to promote the full implementation by all States by reaching out to countries, facilitating technical assistance, and promoting shared experience and lessons learned.
The Security Council stated that not all States have presented to the Resolution 1540 Committee the state's national reports on implementation of Resolution 1540 and that the full implementation of Resolution 1540 by all States is a long-term task that will require continuous efforts at national, regional and international levels.
The Security Council stated that full implementation of Resolution 1540 by all States includes the adoption of national laws and measures to ensure implementation of the Resolution 1540 inspired national laws.
Dumisani Kumalo stated that many developing countries find the reporting requirements for Resolution 1540 and other resolutions onerous when they are trying to provide food, health care and jobs for the people of developing countries.
Dumisani Kumalo is the current Security Council president and South Africa's United Nations ambassador.
Dumisani Kumalo stated that one of the things that South Africa is happy about is that countries must cooperate in dealing with the networks that may be spreading illict nuclear and other weapons.
The 080425 resolution was approved on the day that Mohamed ElBaradei angrily criticized Israel for bombing an alleged Syrian nuclear facility, chastised the United States for withholding information on the alleged Syrian nuclear facility, and stated that the International Atomic Energy Agency would investigate the allegations of the Syrian nuclear facility.

A leading arms expert stated that China's improved nuclear arsenal raises questions about the Chinese government's future arms control efforts.
The expert praised Beijing officials for decreasing sales of weapons abroad.
A leading arms expert stated on 8 May 2008 that Chinese government is making dramatic improvements to China's nuclear arsenal which raises questions for future arms control efforts.
Director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute Bates Gill spoke at a panel for journalists while on a visit to Beijing to promote an annual report on the global arms industry.
Gill stated --
Recent upgrades have increased the accuracy and mobility of China's arsenal while a switch from liquid to solid fuel has shortened reaction times.
China stands out due to the effort to modernize, expand and improve nuclear weapons capability.
Among the 5 nuclear Powers China is making the most dramatic improvements in nuclear force which raises arms control questions.
The Chinese Government stated China will never be the first to use nuclear weapons in a conflict and China's arsenal, estimated at just over 100 nuclear-armed missiles, is the smallest of the 5 main nuclear weapon Powers.
Chinese officials signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1992 and gill stated the recent steps are aimed mainly at reducing the vulnerability of China's deterrent force.
Gill stated that improvements in China's conventional military are even more dramatic after more than 10 years of double-digit percentage increases in annual defense spending.
Gill stated the large increase in the military capability of China is targeted mostly at Taiwan but has the possibility going forward with force projection elsewhere.
Taiwan is a self-governing island that China claims is part of China's territory and has threatened to invade.
Gill stated that the increase in military capability complicates the issue of China as a player in the arms control agenda and that the Chinese government would need to be engaged in future efforts to cap or reduce numbers of nuclear weapons.
Gill praised Beijing officials for decreasing sales of weapons and military technology abroad which Gill believes was largely done out of a desire to be viewed as a more responsible player in international society.
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute China has only a 2 percent share of the global arms export trade.
Gill stated that the shift in the way the Chinese government views the problem of nonproliferation is very positive.
Gill stated that authorities need to strengthen regulation to prevent weapons from entering conflict zones, particularly in Africa where Chinese arms are used by both government and rebel forces in Sudan's Darfur region.
Retired People's Liberation Army Colonel Teng jianqun spoke alongside Gill on the panel and stated that China has substantial restrictions on weapons sales abroad.
Teng conceded that some dealers violated the rules and were beyond the Government's direct control.
Teng stated that further steps were being taken to boost awareness of the rules, partly through courses for government and defense industry leaders run by the foreign ministry-sponsored China Arms Control and Disarmament Association of which Teng is Deputy Secretary-General.
Teng stated a belief that the Chinese have been putting more effort into export controls.

Japan's lower house APPROVES BILL allowing use of space programs in national defense.
The legislation is the most recent effort by Japan to ascribe more freedom to its tightly controlled military and would overturn a ban on the military use of space.
On 13 May 2008 Japan's powerful lower house of parliament voted to allow Japan's space programs to be utilized for national defense.
The legislation is the most recent effort by Japan to ascribe more freedom to the tightly controlled military technically known as a self-defense force.
The legislation is expected to be approved by the upper house.
The legislation is primarily aimed at permitting military use of Japan's civilian-controlled spy satellite network for defense as defined by the pacifist constitution.
The bill states that space development has become increasingly important.
The bill states that space programs must contribute to ensure peace and safety of international society as well as the national security of Japan.
The bill does not specify how the programs will be utilized but the satellite network and other assets could potentially be used for surveillance, planning and for a missile defense shield Japan is constructing with the United States.
The bill would overturn a ban on the military use of space imposed on Japan's nascent space program in 1969.
The U.S.-drafted 1947 Constitution prohibits Japan from offensive warfare.
The legislation stipulates that all members of the cabinet and not just education, science and technology ministers will be responsible for Japan's future space projects.
Inclusion of the defense minister in decisions on space programs introduces the possibility for the military to possess and develop spy satellites.
The legislation would establish a special space task force led by the Prime Minister and create the new post of space development minister.
Japan's Defense Agency was upgraded to Ministry status in 2007.
Japanese troops were dispatched to a combat zone for the first time since World War II in 2004.
The mission in Iraq was strictly humanitarian.
Support.
Both the ruling coalition and the largest opposition party support the bill.
The nation's largest newspaper Yomiuri approved of the bill and urged its quick enactment.
In a weekend editorial the newspaper Yomiuri stated that it is logical to use space development for national security and necessary to counter the threat of North Korea's missile program.
Opposition.
Some pacifist lawmakers from the Communist and Social Democratic parties boycotted the vote on 13 May 2008 stating that the bill contradicted the principle of a civilian-controlled space program.
The left-leaning newspaper Asahi raised concerns that the legislation could escalate friction with neighboring countries.

7 NATO allies to sign agreement to create a cyber Defense Research Center in Estonia.
Experts from NATO member states will be recruited to conduct research and training on cyber warfare and will be prepared to assist allies with response to the growing threat of cyber attack.
7 NATO allies are prepared to sign a deal on 14 May 2008 to create a research center in Tallinn, Estonia to improve the NATO alliance's defenses against cyber attacks.
Cyber attacks are considered a growing threat to military and civilian computer networks.
In 2007 Estonia experienced an unprecedented number of cyber attacks that disabled government and corporate computer networks.
The attacks occurred after a dispute between the Governments of Russia and Estonia over the relocation of a Soviet war memorial.
Many Estonians suspect the Russian government was responsible for the cyber attacks but the Government of Russia denies involvement.
Defense chiefs from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Germany, Italy, Spain and Slovakia will sign the agreement to provide staff and funding for the center.
The United States will join the project as an observer and other NATO nations may join later.
Signing of the Agreement is a peripheral issue of the meeting of Chiefs of Defense Staff from the 26 ally countries of NATO.
The meeting is expected to focus on NATO missions in Afghanistan and Kosovo.
The generals will also discuss cooperation with Balkan and former Soviet nations including Russia and Ukraine.
The Cyber Defense Center will be operational in August 2008 with the formal opening planned for 2009.
A staff of 30 specialists will conduct research and training on cyber warfare and will be prepared to assist NATO members with response to any future cyber attacks.
Head of the center major Raul rikk stated to the Associated Press in Tallinn --
The attacks against Estonia last year were cyber terrorism.
The mission of the center is to create new capabilities to fight new threats.
Experts will be recruited from various NATO member States and from various sectors including information technology, science, military and finance.
Estonia is 1 of Europe's most Internet-savvy nations.
Estonia proposed creation of the center in 2003 but it was not until after the cyber attacks of 2007 that NATO leaders were convinced it was needed.

The agreement will provide staff and funding for the research center.
In 2007 the Estonian Government was struck by cyber attacks.
The cyber attacks crippled government and corporate computer networks.
The cyber attacks were unprecedented.
The cyber attacks followed a dispute over the relocation of a Soviet war memorial in Estonia's capital.
Many suspect the Kremlin of the cyber attacks.
Russia denied involvement with the cyber attacks.
NATO's top commander in charge of military modernization U.S. Gen. James Mattis stated --
NATO will cooperate to bring together the best minds together in cyber defense.
NATO cannot say that NATO will not defend the web that everybody needs.
The U.S. will join the project as an observer.
Other NATO nations may join the project later.
At a news conference at the research center Estonian Defense Minister Jaak Aaviksoo stated that --
Cyber space essentially has no borders.
It is difficult to defend the sovereignty of land and sea borders and air space.
It is even more complicated in borderless cyber space where there is no smoking gun, fingerprints or footprints.
The agreement was signed during a regular meeting of Chiefs of Defense Staff from the 26 NATO allies.
Estonia is a Baltic nation.

Russia proposes cooperation with India and China to increase security around Afghanistan to block drug supplies.
Afghanistan is 1 of the world's major opium producers and supplies Western markets through transit countries such as Russia.
On 15 May 2008 the Government of Russia proposed cooperation with India and China to increase security around Afghanistan in order to block drug supplies.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at a joint news conference in Yekaterinburg with the foreign ministers of India and China stated that tightening security at Afghan borders would decrease the threat of drugs and terrorism.
Lavrov's intentions were not immediately clear since neither Russia nor India has a border with Afghanistan and China's border with Afghanistan is only 76 kilometers (45 miles).
Afghanistan's other neighbors are Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Pakistan.
Afghanistan is 1 of the world's major opium producers and supplies Western markets through transit countries such as Russia.
The Government of Russia states that thousands of Russians die from AIDS-related illnesses each year due to abuse of Afghan-sourced heroin with infected needles.
Officials in Afghanistan's neighboring countries regularly announce large-scale arrests and seizures of narcotics made after illegal convoys cross the border.
Last week drug police in Tajikistan announced their interception of the largest quantity of opium and heroin in Tajikistan's history estimated to be worth approximately 10 million U.S. dollars (6.5 million euro).

Russian Federation President Dmitry Medvedev promised on May 15, 2008 to provide funding for Russia's nuclear missile program.
Russian Federation President Dmitry Medvedev made a debut on May 15, 2008 as commander in chief of the Russian Federation's armed forces by touring a missile base and promising to provide the necessary funding for nuclear forces counter global threats.
Dmitry Medvedev examined Topol-M intercontinental ballistic missiles concealed by the military in a dense pine forest and spoke to officers at the base in teikovo.
Dmitry Medvedev was impressed by the weapons and the level of training.
Dmitry Medvedev also stated that it is good that the military is getting new missiles like the Topol-M.
Missiles from the base in teikovo took part in the Victory Day parade on May 9, 2008 when Russia displayed the country's military hardware on Red Square in Moscow for the first time since the Soviet collapse.
Dmitry Medvedev experienced motivation while watching the missiles across the square and promised that such parades will continue and may be expanded in the future.
Dmitry Medvedev stated that the Russian Federation's task for the next few years is to make sure that the Strategic Missile Forces receive the necessary funding to respond to modern threats.
Dmitry Medvedev also stated that certain progress has been made recently and that the speed of progress must not be lost.
Dmitry Medvedev promised to raise officers' salaries.
Dmitry Medvedev was sworn in on May 7, 2008 as the Russian Federation's President and has so far portrayed an image of a liberal and avoided the harsh anti-western rhetoric of Vladimir Putin.
Vladimir Putin was Dmitry Medvedev's predecessor and mentor.
Most observers expect Dmitry Medvedev to continue the policies of Vladimir Putin, such as an assertive posture on the international scene and vow to strengthen the military.
Teikovo is a small town in the Ivanovo region about 250 kilometers or 155 miles northeast of Moscow.
Vladimir Putin fiercely opposed the United States' plans to deploy missile defense sites in Poland and the Czech Republic, and NATO's plans to accept into the alliance Russia's ex-Soviet neighbors, Ukraine and Georgia.
Vladimir Putin has threatened to point nuclear missiles at countries that take part in U.S. missile defense and opted out of a key Soviet-era arms control treaty.
Topol-M missiles are capable of hitting targets more than 10000 kilometers or 6000 miles away.
The missiles are deployed in both silo-based and truck-mounted versions.
Strategic missiles forces chief General Nikolai Solovtsov stated that the Topol-M is a new step in missile design.
Vladimir Putin and other officials have boasted about the Topol-M's ability to penetrate any prospective missile defense.
Yuri solomonov designed the missile and stated that the missile drops engines at a significantly lower altitude than earlier designs which makes it hard for an enemy's early warning system to detect the launch.
Yuri solomonov stated that the missiles' warhead and decoys closely resemble one another in flight, making it very difficult for a foe to select the real target from a multitude of false ones.
Deployment of topol=ms has proceeded slowly.
Large oil revenues in recent years have allowed the Government of the Russia Federation to buy weapons and fund the development of new missiles.
Soviet-built ballistic missiles have remained the backbone of the nation's nuclear forces.
The Navy of the Russian Federation is in poor shape.
Soviet-built nuclear submarines frequently need repairs and rarely leave the bases.
The Yuri dolgoruky is the first in a series of new nuclear submarines to be commissioned this year but the bulava nuclear-armed missile developed to equip the submarine has failed tests and the deployment prospects are uncertain.

Expert states that Iranian missile launch photo was doctored to show failed 4th missile launching.
20080710 director of the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies's non-proliferation program and former US State Department official Mark Fitzpatrick stated that an Iranian photograph showing a cluster of missile launches from a desert range was altered to add a 4th missile.
The image was posted 20080709 on the Sepah news site, which is run by Iran's Revolutionary Guards.
20080710 the image was replaced with an image of the same 3 missiles in the previous photo but in place of the 4th missile is a grounded missile and what appears to be a vehicle nearby.
20080710 the image with 4 launches was absent from Sepah's main page but both images were in the archive.
Fitzpatrick stated that the photo was probably manipulated to obscure the failure of the 4th missile in order to maintain the impact of Iran's demonstration of power.
Iranian officials did not immediately comment on the photos.
The image was described as depicting part of military maneuvers in which nine missiles were test fired, including an enhanced version of the Shahab-3.
Iranian officials stated that the enhanced Shahab-3 missile has a range of 1250 miles and thus could reach Israel and the majority of the Middle East.
The US government immediately criticized the missile test.

Russian prosecutors have sent the case against ANAR Godzhayev to court after charging Godzhayev with attempting to smuggle tantalum powder to Iran.
Godzhayev could be sentenced to 7 years in prison if convicted.
The Russian Prosecutor General's Office stated on 17 July 2008 that the founder of a Russian company involved in trade with Iran has been charged with trying to smuggle a metal that can be used for weapons of mass destruction or delivery systems to the Islamic Republic.
The Prosecutor General's Office said in a statement --
Prosecutors in southern Russia's Astrakhan region across the Caspian Sea from Iran have sent the case against ANAR Godzhayev to court.
The metal in question is tantalum.
Tantalum can be used in the production of chemical processing equipment, nuclear reactors and missile parts and is subject to export restrictions under Russian law.
Tantalum powder is a super-grade chemical and can be used in the manufacture of mobile phones, personal computers, motor vehicles and electronics goods.
Prosecutors have stated that Godzhayev lied about the contents of an outgoing shipment in customs documents after a business partner asked Godzhayev to send more than a ton of materials containing tantalum to Iran in July 2007.
Godzhayev was detained after customs officials checked the shipment in a container on a boat due to leave for Iran.
Godzhayev is a citizen of Uzbekistan and could face trial soon.
Godzhayev could be sentenced to 7 years in prison if convicted.
Godzhayev is being held in Astrakhan.
Godzhayev and Godzhayev's lawyers were not immediately available to comment.
The Russian government support Iran's right to nuclear energy and is building Iran's first nuclear power plant.
The Russian government has stated there is no evidence proving claims by the U.S. and other Western countries that the Iranian government is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.
Officials in Moscow are involved in international efforts to persuade the Iranian government to ease fears by abandoning uranium enrichment.
The Russian government has also questioned U.S. assessments of the potential threat from Iranian missiles.
Russian and United States leaders have maintained cooperation in efforts to thwart the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

A U.N. representative stated that the conversion of opium resin into heroin is increasingly being done inside Afghanistan but that the chemicals needed to complete the conversion are being smuggled into Afghanistan from other countries.
The U.N. representative requested the international community share more information on known smugglers of the chemicals.
The U.N. stated on 28 July 2008 that the international community should do more to stop chemicals used to convert opium to heroin from reaching Afghanistan and detailed increasing sophistication in Afghanistan's drug trade.
Afghanistan produces more than 90 percent of the world's opium.
Opium production in Afghanistan has increased since the U.S.-led invasion removed the Taliban regime in 2001.
Officials in the American-backed government and Taliban militants are believed to profit from the illicit trade.
U.N. figures show Afghanistan yielded approximately 9000 tons of opium in 2007 which could create more than 900 tons of heroin.
Afghanistan's representative for the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime Christina Oguz stated the conversion of opium resin into heroin is increasingly being done inside Afghanistan mostly at laboratories in the border regions in the insurgency-plagued South and the East.
Oguz stated to reporters in Kabul that evidence of higher quality Afghan heroin indicates that the people running the labs are getting assistance from chemists who have come from outside the country as foreign consultants.
Oguz stated the chemists originated from countries near the border but did not detail specific countries.
Oguz stated the chemicals needed to make the heroin were being smuggled from China, South Korea, European countries, including Russia, and other parts of the world.
Oguz stated the so-called precursor chemicals such as acetic anhydride also have legal uses including in the paint and pharmaceutical industries.
Oguz stated the chemicals often are legally exported but later diverted to Afghanistan for illicit goals and Afghanistan has no major legal industries that would require such chemicals.
Oguz stated --
Blaming Afghanistan alone for the heroin problem in the world is not correct.
Afghanistan does produce the opium which is the raw material for heroin but it is not possible to make heroin without certain chemicals that are not produced inside Afghanistan and are smuggled into Afghanistan.
More than 200 tons of the chemicals have been seized by Afghan authorities since 2006 but some 13000 tons were needed based on 2007's opium production figures.
The figures suggest the confiscated amount represented a small fraction of the total smuggled in.
Most seizures of the chemicals occur along the eastern border with Pakistan but a good deal comes via the western border with Iran.
Oguz stated the international community should share more information on known smugglers of the chemicals who were long-established and based in Afghanistan's neighboring countries.
Western officials are increasingly concerned that Taliban militants are bankrolling the insurgency through the drug trade.
The U.N. briefing comes in the wake of allegations that Afghan President Hamid Karzai protected drug lords for political reasons.
A former senior U.S. State Department counter-narcotics official wrote in an article in the 27 July 2008 issue of New York Times magazine that narco-corruption went to the top of the Afghan Government.
The official alleged Karzai was reluctant to move against big drug lords in Karzai's political power base in the south of Afghanistan where most opium is produced.
Karzai has stated commitment to eliminating corruption and battling the drug trade.
Oguz stated on 28 July 2008 that corruption exists within the system but Afghanistan lacked a well-trained police force for many years and officials are only now taking steps in fighting corruption.

Estonia is hosting some Georgian websites to protect the websites from hackers.
Officials stated on August 26, 2008 that Estonia is temporarily hosting the websites of Georgia's Central Bank and Foreign Ministry as well as a Georgian English-languages news portal in order to protect the websites from cyber attacks.
The state-run Estonian informatics Center stated that Georgia has transferred key websites to services in other countries including Poland and France after some came under attack following the outbreak of war with Russia.
Estonian informatics center spokeswoman Katrin pargmae stated that hosting websites in different countries makes the websites more complicated and time-consuming for hackers to disrupt.
Katrin pargmae also stated that hosting the websites will help Georgia's webpages be visible to the world.
Katrin pargmae did not comment on the Georgian attacks.
Estonia has previous experience coping with cyber attacks because Estonian government and private sector websites were targeted in May 2007.
The May 2007 attacks were days after Estonia decided to relocate a Soviet war memorial and grave.
The relocation angered Estonia's ethnic Russian minority and neighboring Russia.
Estonian officials did not accuse any country of mounting what the Estonian Government stated were highly organized and professional attacks.
Estonia is a Baltic state.

The European Union's highest court on September 3, 2008 overturned a verdict to freeze the assets of multiple individuals and groups accused of funding terrorist organizations.
The European Union's highest court on September 3, 2008 overturned a 2001 decision by European Union governments to freeze the assets of a Saudi businessman and a Sweden-based charity suspected of funding Al-Qaida terror groups.
The ruling conflicts with a United Nations anti-terror order obliging United Nations Member States to freeze assets of people and entities suspected of funding terror groups.
The European Union's highest court also stated that the United Nations order failed to offer individuals on a terror blacklist or individuals on the defense any legal rights to a judicial review under European law.
The European Union's highest court acknowledged that the reasons for freezing the assets of Yasin Al-Qadi and the Al-Barakaat International Foundation may be justified.
It is not known whether European Union nations which have set up a joint terror blacklist will unfreeze the assets.
None of the groups have so far been officially removed from the blacklist because European Union Governments argue the court rulings do not oblige the European Union nations to remove the names from the list but only force the European Union to inform the individuals and groups on the list that the assets have been frozen.
Head of the Saudi-based Muwafaq Foundation Yasin Al-Qadi appealed against the European Union's decision to freeze proprietary assets.
United States Treasury officials allege the Muwafaq Foundation is an al-Qaida Front used to funnel millions of dollars and euros to al-Qaida.
Al-Barakaat International appealed the European Union's decision to freeze 1 million Swedish kroner or 152247 United States dollars.
Lawyers for Al-Barakaat International stated that the money was being used to fund aid programs for families in Somalia.
Thomas Olsson stated that the lawyers for Al-Barakaat International would now examine ways of having the assets released to the Somali immigrants in Sweden who used the network to send funds to relatives in Somalia.
Thomas Olsson also stated that the lawyers for Al-Barakaat International have to examine the judicial consequences of the verdict as the sanctions remain on a United Nations level.
The European Union's highest court stated on September 3, 2008 that the 27-nation European Union is required to inform any person whose assets are being frozen why as swiftly as possible after the decision is taken in order to allow the person with frozen assets the right to legal recourse.
Swedish lawyer Thomas Olsson who represented Al-Barakaat in the case approved of the ruling.
This ruling may hinder international efforts to stop the financing of terror groups including al-Qaida.
The ruling overturns an earlier 2005 European Union court decision that rejected the appeals of Al-Qadi and the Al-Barakaat international foundation.
The ruling stated that the lower European Union's court judgment erred in law by stating that European Union courts had no jurisdiction to review the legality of the contested order to freeze assets of individuals and groups deemed to be funding terror groups by the United Nations.
Other suspects and groups on an European Union terror blacklist have also won legal victories for similar reasons against being listed.
These suspects and groups have so far not had assets unfrozen or names removed from the European Union's blacklist.
The European Union's High Court had previously overturned an European Union decision to freeze the assets of the People's Mujahadeen of Iran.
The People's Mujahadeen of Iran is an exiled Iranian Resistance movement that is on the European Union's terror blacklist.
The European Union's High Court recently overturned a decision to freeze the assets of an exiled Philippine rebel leader and the Netherlands-based Al-Aqsa Foundation because the leader and group were not informed why the assets were frozen which is a breach of EU law.
370 people have had assets frozen because of placement on a terrorist blacklist by the United Nations Security Council.
The European Union's blacklist also targets about 60 organizations.

On September 9, 2008 Swedish Prosecutor Ronnie Jacobsson dropped charges against the 3 Swedes arrested on suspicion of funding terrorism.
Swedish Prosecutor Ronnie Jacobsson stated on September 9, 2008 that charges will not be pressed against the 3 Swedes arrested on suspicion of funding terrorism earlier in 2008.
The charges are being dropped because Ronnie jaccobson cannot provide that the men had intended to send money to terrorist organizations.
The Swedes were accused of using the informal money transfer networks called hawalas to send funds to alleged terror groups in Somalia.
The 3 Swedes were arrested in raids in Stockholm in February.
The raid was coordinated with a crackdown in Norway where another 3 suspects were arrested on similar grounds.
Ronnie Jacobsson stated that the Norwegian investigation is still ongoing.
The 3 Swedes are 30 or 40 years old.
Hawalas are a paperless system based on trust and oral agreements which is commonly used in the Middle East and parts of Asia and Africa.
Defense lawyer Thomas Olsson stated it was very tragic and a failure for Swedish law and order that the client Thomas Olsson was representing had been kept in detention for such a long time despite the weak evidence against client.
2 of the men were held for more than 3 months before being released at the start of the summer of 2008.
Ronnie Jacobsson stated that a court had examined the detention order every 2 weeks and found there was reason to keep the men detained.
Both Norway and Sweden have been spared violent terror acts but authorities in both countries have voiced concern about terrorists or terror financiers operating out of Scandinavia.
In 2005 2 Iraqis were sentenced to prison in Sweden for collecting and transferring money to terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.
Abu Musab al-Zarqawi is the late leader of al-Qaida in Iraq.

Russian president Dmitry Medvedev stated that Russia's military conflict with Georgia in August 2008 highlighted the Russian military's need for modernization.
Medvedev plans to have a guaranteed nuclear deterrent system in place by 2020 which will include warships and nuclear-powered submarines.
Russian president Dmitry Medvedev stated on 26 September 2008 that the Russian military must modernize armed forces and upgrade nuclear deterrent by building a new air and space defense network.
Medvedev also announced plans to begin large-scale production of warships including nuclear-powered submarines armed with cruise missiles.
Medvedev issued the statement to military commanders after military exercises in the southern Orenburg region.
The statement was posted on the Kremlin web site and carried by state news agencies.
Medvedev stated --
The need for modernization was demonstrated by the military conflict with Georgia in August 2008.
Russian military responded to Georgia's attack on the breakaway region of South Ossetia with force and defeated the Georgian army but the brief war highlighted Russia's aging arsenal.
The Russian military must ensure superiority in the air, in carrying out precision strikes at land and sea targets and in the timely deployment of forces.
Russia must have a guaranteed nuclear deterrent system in place by 2020 and gave military commanders until December 2008 to devise a plan.
The Russian military needs multi-purpose attack submarines and nuclear-powered submarines armed with cruise missiles.
Medvedev did not mention the new borei-class nuclear submarines which are designed to carry a new intercontinental missile that is seen as a key future component of Russia's nuclear forces.
The missile was successfully test fired the week of 14 September 2008 after several failures.
The first of the new submarines is to be commissioned later in 2008 and 2 more are being built.
Russia's economic problems after the 1991 Soviet collapse affected the armed forces but the Kremlin has recently been directing more money from oil profits into new weapons systems.

A Dutch government investigation has found that a Russian cluster bomb killed a television cameraman in Georgia in 070000.
The Dutch Foreign Ministry said on 081020 that a Dutch government investigation has found that a Russian cluster bomb killed a television cameraman in Georgia in 070000.
Dutchman Stan Storiman died during the conflict over the breakaway province of South Ossetia while filming the fighting in Gori, Georgia.
Storimans was killed while filming on a large and nearly deserted square in Gori.
Reporter Jeroen Akkermans said several Georgian civilians died in the same attack.
Akkermans was working with Storimans and suffered minor injuries.
Storimans was a veteran newsman employed by RTL Nieuws.
RTL Nieuws is ultimately owned by German media conglomerate Bertelsmann AG.
The Dutch foreign ministry said a Dutch investigative team sent to the spot 2 weeks later to gather forensic evidence and eyewitness accounts concluded Storimans was killed by a munition propelled by a type of rocket that is only found in Russia's military arsenal.
Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen called the findings very serious.
Verhagen said in a statement that Verhagen had made that clear to the Russian authorities cluster munitions must not be used in this way.
There were no troops present in Gori and innocent civilians were killed.
The Russian government denied using cluster munitions during its brief war with Georgia in 070800.
Human rights groups say both sides unleashed the widely denounced weapons.
The georgiann Government has acknowledged using used ground-launched cluster munitions near the roki tunnel connecting South Ossetia with Russia.
Verhagen said the Netherlands Government plans to raise the matter with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe addresses arms control issues and includes both Russia and Georgia as members.
The Dutch Foreign Ministry said Dutch government representatives will call for a political statement to be issued in which Member States pledge not to use cluster weapons in situations of this kind.
Cluster bomblets are packed into artillery shells or bombs dropped from aircraft.
A single container typically scatters some 200 to 600 of the mini-explosives over an area the size of a football field.
Cluster bomblets have been criticized by human rights groups because they kill indiscriminately and because unexploded ordinance poses a threat to civilians similar to that of land mines.
More than 100 countries agreed in Dublin, Ireland, in 080500 to ban cluster bombs within 8 years.
Neither the Georgian nor Russian Governments signed the accord.

A Paris Criminal Court convicted nine people on October 23, 2008.
This included a French-Algerian former prison inmate who admitted establishing an Islamic group that called for armed Jihad in France.
Safe Bourada was sentenced to 15 years in prison.
Eight others received penalties of one to nine years on charges linked to financing of and association with a terror group.
Bourada admitted in court to creating a militant group called Ansar Al-Fath or partisans of victory.
The group was suspected of planning attacks on the Paris metro and Orly airport.
It was dismantled in 2005 after French authorities received a tip from Algerian counterparts.
Bourada was one of 36 Islamic militants convicted ten years ago for providing support for bombings that terrorized France in 1995.
Bourada received a 10-year term, but won early release in 2003 under police surveillance.
Bourada will not be eligible for parole for at least 10 years under the October 23, 2008 verdict.
Head of the counter-terrorism unit of the National Police Christophe chaboud told the Associated Press in 2005 that the group had had indirect contacts with Iraq's former al-Qaida leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.
Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was killed in a U.S. airstrike in June 2006 in Diyala province.
The court ruled that group member Kaci ouarab had received weapons training in Lebanon in 2005 that was designed to help carry out bombings in France.
Ouarab was sentenced to nine years without the possibility of parole for at least six.
The Court considered ouarab to be the natural, legitimate and operational successor of Bourada.
Kais Melliti was considered an important organizing and financial operative.
Melliti was given eight years without the possibility of parole for at least two-thirds of that term.
Djamel badaoui was sentenced to five years.
The court ruled badaoui was in charge of seizing goods by extorting money from prostitutes on three occasions to fund terror attacks.
Stephane hadoux and Emmanuel Nieto were given three-year sentences.
Half were suspended by the court.
The two are French converts to Islam.

On 081031 some United Nation's General Assembly's member nations voted to move ahead with creating an unprecedented treaty regulating the global arms trade despite United States opposition.
Britain and 6 other nations supporting an unprecedented treaty regulating the global arms trade won an overwhelming endorsement from the United Nations General Assembly on 081031 to move forward with the creation of the treaty regulating the global arms trade despite opposition from the United States.
147 of the United Nations's 192 member nations voted on 081031 to move ahead with crafting the proposed arms trade treaty.
Most of the nations that did not vote to move ahead with crafting the proposed arms trade treat abstained from 081031 vote.
China abstained from the 081031 vote.
Only the United States and Zimbabwe voted against moving ahead with the treaty regulating the global arms trade.
The United States and Zimbabwe were bitter opponents in 080700 concerning the United States-proposed sanctions on Zimbabwe's leaders that were vetoed by Russia and China.
Proponents of the treaty regulating the global arms trade stated that they hope to craft and adopt a treaty within 3 to 5 years with the aim of imposing controls on an international arms trade that contributes to the killing of more than 1000 people a day.
Great Britain, Japan, Australia, Argentina, Costa Rica, Kenya and Finland have been leading proponents of the treaty regulating the global arms trade.
Great Britain is a 3 billion United States dollar per year arms exporter.
The treaty regulating the global arms trade would apply only to arms sales among nations and not commercial sales involving individuals.
Decisions would require a simple majority.
John Duncan stated that the treaty regulating the global arms trade has to be as universal as possible and that some the countries are arms manufacturers and that all nations are arms suppliers at one stage or another.
John Duncan stated that it is by closing loopholes that nations can stop arms distribution into the hands of criminals and terrorists.
John Duncan is Great Britain's ambassador for multilateral arms control and disarmament.
The United States favors language contained in some of the negotiating documents about treaty regulating the global arms trade that require consensus decisions that essentially give the United States and other nations veto power.
The United States diplomat Christina Rocca stated that the only way to achieve a balanced and effective international mechanism for controlling trade in conventional arms is to proceed on a consensus basis.
Christina Rocca made this statement to other nations assembled for the vote on moving ahead with the treaty regulating the global arms trade.
In 061200 the United States cast the sole dissenting vote when 153 nations voted in support of considering the creation of a treaty regulating the global arms trade.
The 061200 vote set in motion the process of considering an arms trade treaty.
That process included meetings from 071031 to 081031 among a group of experts that recommended items for consideration that included the consensus language.
The 081031 vote will move forward arms trade treaty discussions toward the specifics of the possible language of the arms trade treaty.
Christina Rocca stated that the United States supports the goal of promoting responsibility in arms transfers and reducing the destabilizing trade in illicit arms.
Christina Rocca stated that the United States does not believe a global arms trade treaty would accomplish the promotion of responsibility in arms transfers and the reduction of the destabilizing trade in illicit arms.
Christina Rocca stated that the only way to convince all major arms exporting countries to sign on to the arms trade treaty would be to weaken the arms trade treaty provisions and a weak arms trade treaty would legitimize an international standard based on a lowest common denominator that would not address the problem of illicit and irresponsible arms transfers.

A report by the International Campaign to Ban Landmines said Greece, Turkey and Belarus missed treaty deadlines to destroy their land mine stockpiles.
A 081121 report by the International Campaign to Ban Landmines said Greece, Turkey and Belarus have missed deadlines that were required under an international treaty to destroy their land mine stockpiles.
Diplomats from Greece, Turkey and Belarus declined to be interviewed about the report in Geneva.
The report quoted the Governments of Greece, Turkey and Belarus as acknowledging that the deadlines have been missed.
Greece, Turkey and Belarus should have destroyed a total of nearly 7.5 million land mines by 080300.
The 1155-page annual report by the International Campaign to Ban Landmines said Greece mentioned legal problems with contracting a company to carry out the destruction and the difficulty of finding environmentally safe destruction sites as reasons for the delay.
Turkey's government claimed preparations for getting rid of Turkish stockpiles took longer than planned.
Belarus said there were delays in receiving support funds from the European Union.
Belarus said remaining stockpiles contains a type of mine that is more difficult and costly to destroy.
Arms Control director of New York-based Human Rights Watch Steve Goose said Greece, Turkey and Belarus will not face sanctions for missing their deadlines.
Human Rights Watch helped produce the report.
The report said only 500000 mines were destroyed worldwide over the past year but said Afghanistan, Burundi and Sudan got rid of all of stockpiles respectively.
The report said the number of destroyed stockpiled mines since the treaty to ban land mines came into force in 990000 has been brought to more than 42 million but that 44 countries still have 176 million mines.
All of the 156 countries that have joined the Treaty are given 4 years to destroy their stockpiles.
Major users of land mines such as the U.S., Russia and China have not signed the Treaty.
The report said more than 1400 people were killed and 3900 wounded by land mine explosions worldwide in 070000 and added the number may be much higher because reporting is poor in many countries.
The International Campaign to Ban Landmines won the Nobel Peace Prize in 970000.

An institute for public policy research report said there are 27 weak states that pose a threat to Britain's national security as the States could provide bases for terrorists.
The report stated British government must help to stabilize weak states and push for international regulations.
A report published on 27 November 2008 stated Britain is vulnerable to terrorists operating out of weak States where terrorists can run training camps and raise funds undetected.
The report was co-authored by former NATO chief George Robertson and published by international think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research.
The report said there are 27 weak states that pose a threat to Britain's national security as the States could provide bases for terrorists.
The countries include Haiti, Nigeria, Somalia and Yemen and have vulnerable Governments that are unwilling or unable to control the territories.
The report's authors stated criminal groups that fund terrorist organizations through drug trafficking and manufacturing counterfeit goods can operate in weak States without being detected.
Terrorists who raise funds in these States could then coordinate an attack on Britain.
The report stated transnational terrorists have discovered that the global space is largely unregulated with the rule of law either weak or nonexistent and is a place where terrorists can operate with a reasonable prospect of impunity as in the mountains of Afghanistan before 9/11.
Deputy Director of the ippr and 1 of the report's authors Ian kearns stated terrorists could run camps in remote areas which Governments rarely monitor.
Kearns referenced terrorist training camps in the Sahel which is a region of sub-Saharan Africa that runs though several countries including Mali, Chad and Sudan.
Kearns stated that these remote areas are impossible to patrol and any activity could go undetected.
The report stated British government must help to stabilize weak states and push for international regulations that would stop terrorists using freely available information to create and unleash new forms of biological warfare such as a modified version of the influenza virus.
Kearns stated the Government must take a multilateral approach to areas including biotechnology but that the government is not moving quickly enough on the approach.
Kearns stated the global financial crisis shows the results of not having multilateral frameworks in place to deal with international issues.

The the Ministry of Economic Affairs (moea) approved lingsen precision industries, King yuan electronics, IC Assembly company Sigurd Corp. and Siliconware precision industries for Chinese investment.
On 8 April 2008 the Ministry of Economic Affairs (moea) announced approval for 4 Chinese investment proposals from Chinese manufacturers.
Lingsen precision industries, King yuan electronics, IC Assembly company Sigurd Corp. and Siliconware precision industries were approved for investment and will invest in integrated circuit packaging (ICP) and testing.
The companies will invest 10 million US dollars, 20 million US dollars, 6.7 million US dollars, and 50 million US dollars respectively.
The proposals have a total investment amount of 86.7 million US dollars (2.64 billion NT dollars).
The moea determined in a meeting on 8 April 2008 that the investment proposals met the clauses in the China Investment procedure issued by the ministry's Investment Commission.
The Investment Commission's Executive Secretary Fan Liang-Tung stated the investment procedure aims to ensure Taiwan's investments in China will not harm Taiwan's industries and economy such as by leaking key technologies to the mainland.
Under the procedure investment plans require approval from the moea if the plans involve a single investment that exceeds 100 million US dollars, the company's total investment in China reaches 200 million US dollars, or the investment could transfer core local industries' technologies to China.
Fan stated core industries mainly involve the manufacturing of 8-inch wafers and 4-inch TFT panels as well as IC packaging.
After the meeting on 8 April 2008 the Commission requires written documents to further assess the plans which contain each company's commitment on the terms of investment including the financial plan, information on any technology transfers and the company's domestic investment as well as employment information.
Fan stated the Commission is primarily concerned with the term of future investment in Taiwan.
Fan stated lingsen precision industries, King yuan electronics, IC Assembly company Sigurd Corp. and Siliconware precision industries have made commitments to return capital to Taiwan in the amounts of 2 billion NT dollars, 19.2 billion NT dollars, 3 billion NT dollars and 23 billion NT dollars respectively by 2011.
Fan stated the Commission will ensure the commitments are upheld once the investments are under way.
Fan stated the procedure would push Chinese investment from Taiwan to focus on down scale manufacturers rather than technology-concentrated makers in a bid to keep high-end technologies in Taiwan.
Fan stated the Commission will hold a 2nd round of meetings to decide if the proposals will take effect and that the final decision will be made by 30 April 2008.

Iran refuses commitment to halt expansion but hints a possible future halt.
20080726 Iranian President Mahmoud ahmadinejad stated to scholars in the northeastern city of mashbad that Iran had expanded its arsenal of centrifuges producing enriched uranium to over 5000.
The statement was ahmadinejad's first asserting an expansion since the 20080400 announcement that Iran was approaching the implementation of 6000 centrifuges.
Iran articulated the goal of 50000 centrifuges operating at the enrichment plant near the town of Natanz.
The international community has demanded that Iran halt the production of nuclear material.
Media reports differed on the number of centrifuges ahmadinejad cited.
An Iranian news agency reported that ahmadinejad stated Iran had 6000 working centrifuges but the agency subsequently removed the statement from the Internet.
Another Iranian news agency stated that ahmadinejad referred to 100000s of centrifuges.
Experts discounted the significance of ahmadinejad's claim in the absence of information on the centrifuges' functionality.
A Western diplomat in Tehran speaking under condition of anonymity stated that the quantity of centrifuges is less important than whether the machines are operational and efficient but that ahmadinejad's assertion will hinder a resolution of the diplomatic standoff between Iran and the West.
Arms control expert Jeffrey G. Lewis of the new America Foundation think tank stated that the Foundation was aware of Iran's goal of assembling 6000 centrifuges but the operational status of the machines is unknown.
Diplomats and arms control experts stated that the Iranian enrichment program is hindered by technical problems.
Iran has repeatedly asserted that its nuclear program aims to produce only electricity because nuclear weapon production contradicts Islamic principles.
The US, Israel, Europe and the majority of Western arms control experts believe that Iran is pursuing the capability to produce bombs immediately in the event of a decision.
Experts stated that producing weapons-grade uranium from reactor-grade material is relatively simple.
Ahmadinejad stated that after Iran resisted the West's demands for a halt in nuclear activities, the West still pursued the resumption of negotiations.
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana recently presented Iran with 2 offers --
A US-endorsed package of incentives to cease enriched uranium production
A 6-week pre-negotiation' freeze for freeze' period during which Iran would add no centrifuges and the West would refrain from promoting a 4th round of economic sanctions against Iran at the UN Security Council.
US officials repeatedly stated that no negotiations can begin before Iran verifiably halts all enrichment-related activities but the Bush administration recently agreed to the' freeze for freeze' proposal and dispatch burns to Geneva.
20080726 during talks in Geneva attended by US Undersecretary of State William J. Burns Iran refused to respond to Solana's offers.
The talks constituted the highest-level diplomatic contact between the US and Iran for nearly 30 years.
Solana, burns and European envoys set a deadline for Iran to respond positively before initiating new sanctions including prohibitions on selling Iran refined petroleum products vital to the country's economy.
Iranian officials refused to commit to stopping expansion or to observe the deadline.
20080726 ahmadinejad appeared to suggest that Iran might potentially halt expansion at a higher number of centrifuges that previously expected and for over 6 weeks.
Ahmadinejad stated that the West had consented to the existing 5000-6000 centrifuges in operation provided that the number did not increase.
5000 centrifuges can produce sufficient nuclear material for a power plant or an atomic bomb if the material is highly enriched.
6000 centrifuges running continuously can produce sufficient weapons-grade uranium for 1 bomb in 6 months.
20080500 the International Atomic Energy Agency stated that Iran possessed 3500 centrifuges in operations.

A diplomatic meeting in Paris concludes with no agreement on further steps to pressure Iran to halt uranium enrichment at Iran's facility in Natanz.
On 081114 diplomats stated to the media that American, European, Russian and Chinese officials at a meeting on 081113 in Paris did not reach agreement on further actions to persuade Iran to halt uranium enrichment at Iran's facility in Natanz.
Uranium enrichment is a highly technical process that can produce fuel for a nuclear power plant or fissile material for atomic weapons.
The 081113 meeting ended without any new measures to announce.
After the 081113 meeting the French foreign ministry released a statement declaring the international community had reaffirmed the importance of the dual-track approach of engaging diplomatically with Iran and working towards sanctions.
Russia and China have resisted new sanctions against Iran.
Russia and China have close political and business ties with Iran and feel no domestic pressure to act against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
The United States does not have close political and business ties with Iran and feels domestic pressure to act against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Russia and China hold veto power over Security Council decisions.
Moscow's Interfax news agency quoted Russian diplomat Sergei ryabkov as stating that the parties struck no deal on sanctions against Iran at the 081113 meeting and that the Western countries are in favor of the sanctions against Iran while China and Russia did not support sanctions against Iran.
Sergei ryabkov attended the 081113 meeting.
A report released this week says Iran has made significant progress at Iran's heavy-water research reactor facility near the city of Arak.
Iran's heavy-water research reactor near Arak could eventually produce plutonium that might be used in a nuclear weapon.
Satellite images published by the Institute for Science and International Security show construction at the heavy-water research reactor facility near the city of Arak has progressed significantly between 080200 and 081000.
David Albright stated that Iran's heavy-water research reactor near Arak has evaded the international security community's notice.
David Albright stated that Iran's heavy-water research reactor near Arak is making significant progress according to the satellite images and that in a year and a half the heavy-water research reactor near Arak has progressed from building frames to a largely finished facility.
David Albright is a former arms inspector and Director of the Institute for Science and International Security that is based in Washington, D.C..
Iran stated that Iran is pursuing nuclear technology to produce energy and conduct research.
The United States and its western allies suspect that Iran's efforts to produce is a precursor to creating a nuclear-weapons infrastructure.
Low-grade uranium production is legal under international arms-control regulations.
The latest developments in Iran's nuclear technology development show the complex diplomatic and technical challenges facing the incoming foreign policy team of United States President-elect Barack Obama when it takes on the task of stopping Iran from mastering technology that could be used to manufacture and deliver nuclear weapons.
The administration of United States President George W. Bush in its last months in power has managed to synchronize United States policies with the European Union, British, French and German leaders, to press for tougher sanctions and diplomatic action against Iran.
The International Atomic Energy Agency is expected to release a report critical of Iran next week.
The International Atomic Energy Agency is the United Nations's nuclear watchdog agency.
Due to the Act that no new initiatives regarding Iran's nuclear program emerged from the 081113 Paris talks the hopes of imposing another set of United Nations Security Council sanctions before the end of President Bush's term were decreasing.
While diplomatic maneuvering is taking place Iran continues to work towards mastering nuclear and missile technology.
Some Israeli officials have stated their alarm about Iran's test-firing this week of a solid-fuel, two-stage rocket with a range of 1200 miles.
The city of Tel Aviv is fewer than 650 miles from Iranian territory.

Iranian News Agency Fars stated that hackers known as group XP defaced or blocked 100s of Shiite-related websites.
The official website of Iraq's Shiite leader the Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani was among the websites defaced and blocked.
Group XP stated on the defaced website that any website that contained material contrary to Sunni teachings would be hacked.
The official website of Iraq's Shiite religious leader the Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani was defaced and blocked in a sectarian-motivated cyber attack on Shiite-related sites.
It was not clear whether the attack began on 18 September 2008 or the morning of 19 September 2008.
By the evening of 19 September 2008 Al-Sistani's website was offline.
Another website related to 1 of Al-Sistani's religious organizations, www.al-shia.com, was also affected.
An alternative address, www.sistani.com, was still operational.
Iranian News Agency Fars stated that group XP had blocked access to approximately 300 Shiite-related sites on 18 September 2008 and 19 September 2008.
Neither the hacking claim nor an Iranian assertion that group XP was based in the United Arab Emirates could be verified independently.
Several Iranian news sites stated on 19 September 2008 that many of the Shiite and Iran-related web sites that had been attacked were running normally again.
A statement signed group XP was posted on the home page of Al-Sistani's web site and stated that the attack was on behalf of Sunni Muslims.
The statement said --
Group XP had carried out similar attacks on other Shiite sites in the Persian Gulf and Iraq.
Group XP erased the site as group XP has done with other Rafidha sites.
Rafidha means rejecters and is an insult used by Sunni extremists to describe Shiites.
Al-Sistani promoted sexual deviance and an Iranian agenda in Iraq as Al-Sistani was born in Iran.
Any website with material that was contrary to Sunni teachings would be punished.
The statement also consisted of a youtube video clip of American comedian bill Maher ridiculing a fatwa by Al-Sistani on whether certain positions of sexual intercourse were permitted for married couples.
The ayatollah's office in Najaf declined to comment on the cyber attack.
Fars reported that a counterattack had been carried out against 2 major Wahhabi web sites which belong to puritanical strain of Sunni Islam that is dominant in Saudi Arabia.

Somali pirates who hijacked a Ukrainian freighter carrying a large cargo of arms are approaching a deal for the ship's release.
Questions have emerged regarding the shipment of arms en route to Kenya and of a possible clandestine arms deal between Kenya and South Sudan.
On 08 October 2008 Maritime officials and associates of the Somali pirates who on 25 September 2008 hijacked a Ukrainian freighter carrying a large cargo of arms stated that the pirates may soon be collecting their ransom.
After difficult negotiations likened by several people involved to bazaar-style haggling the parties are close to reaching a deal in which the pirates would be paid millions of dollars and the ship freed.
A businessman in xarardheere, Somalia named Ahmed Omar stated that the pirates and the ship owners have agreed on a ransom of approximately 8 million U.S. dollars and the ship may be freed on 08 October 2008 or 09 October 2008.
Xarardheere is a notorious pirate base on the coast of Somalia.
Maritime officials in Kenya stated that critical details have yet to be agreed upon.
One such detail involves the pirates' request for a guarantee that they would not be arrested or attacked by the armada of American warships currently encircling them.
A Kenyan maritime official stated anonymously that such negotiations are complex and involve more than the financial aspect.
On 08 October 2008 the official stated that progress is being made and the parties are approaching an agreement.
The pirates initially requested 35 million U.S. dollars and then reduced their request to 20 million U.S. dollars.
The pirates have consistently expressed willingness to negotiate the financial figures.
More than 25 ships have been hijacked in 2008 off the Somalia coast with a typical ransom of between 1 and 2 million U.S. dollars.
The pirates aboard the Ukrainian ship have stated that upon receipt of payment in American dollars and preferably in 100 dollar bills the ship, its cargo and the 20 sailors on board will be released.
The original country of destination for the arms shipment aboard the Ukrainian ship is being questioned.
Shortly after the freighter was hijacked on 25 September 2008 the Kenyan government claimed that the weapons on board were being shipped for Kenya's military.
The ship was en route to Kenya's main port of Mombasa.
The weapons on board the ship included 33 T-72 tanks, 150 grenade launchers, 6 anti-aircraft guns and a large quantity of ammunition.
Evidence has subsequently emerged that the weapons were part of a clandestine arms deal between Kenya and the separatist region of southern Sudan.
The deal would most likely have remained secret had the pirates not hijacked the ship and begun speaking to the media by satellite phone.
Ukrainian officials have been adamant in denying any wrongdoing.
Ukrainian diplomat in Kenya oleh belokolos stated --
Ukraine does not supply or have plans to supply any armaments to the Government of South Sudan.
All the appropriate paperwork has been validated.
Ukraine abides by all United Nations rules and arms control agreements.
Ukraine inherited enormous stockpiles of weaponry after the collapse of the Soviet Union and is now a major arms dealer.
The deal with Ukraine is considered suspicious given that Kenya has mostly relied on the United Kingdom and other western countries for its supply of heavy weapons.
Kenyan politicians were demanding answers and have called for several commissions to examine the situation.
Southern Sudan is an autonomous region that is currently increasing its military and that uses Soviet-designed tanks.
The American military stated that its priority is to ensure that the weapons were not unloaded from the ship and sold to Islamist insurgents in Somalia.
The pirates have denied interest in the weapons and claimed to have been unaware that the cargo included tanks when they hijacked the ship.
Pirate spokesman sugule Ali stated in an interview last week that the pirates' sole interest in the deal is money.

Narcotics
Head of the U.N. drug office Antonio Maria Costa said that Afghanistan has produced so much opium in recent years that the Taliban are cutting back poppy cultivation and stockpiling raw opium in an effort to support prices and preserve a major source of financing for the insurgency.
Head of the U.N. drug office Antonio Maria Costa said that Afghanistan has produced so much opium in recent years that the Taliban are cutting back poppy cultivation and stockpiling raw opium in an effort to support prices and preserve a major source of financing for the insurgency.
Costa said this to reporters last week as the U.N. Drug Office Office prepared to release its latest survey of Afghanistan's opium crop.
The survey showed that poppy cultivation had retreated in much of Afghanistan and was overwhelmingly concentrated in 7 of 34 provinces where the insurgency remains strong, most of those in the south.
The survey was issued November 27, 2008.
The United Nations found that the result was a 19 percent reduction in the amount of land devoted to opium in Afghanistan even though the total tonnage of opium produced dropped by just 6 percent.
The study stated that the high output per acre was attributed to a good growing season in the south.
The southern region is a heavily irrigated area where the Taliban maintained a strong presence in 5 provinces and have systematically encouraged opium cultivation as a way to finance their insurgency for several years.
The U.N. estimates the insurgents made as much as 300 million dollars from the opium trade last year.
Costa said a lot of war effort can be funded with 2 to 300 million dollars.
The Taliban have producing an amount of opium that far exceeds world demand due to 3 successive years of bumper crops.
Costa said the result was a glut that was depressing the price, which dropped by approximately 20 percent.
Costa said that the fact that prices had not collapsed already was evidence that the Taliban, drug lords and even some farmers have stockpiled the opium.
An increasing amount is also being processed in Afghanistan.
Costa added that insurgents have been holding significant amounts of opium.
Costa said the surplus is as much as 11000 tons, or more than twice world demand in the last 3 years and threatened to devalue their stockpiles.
The United Nations found that Afghanistan produced 8500 tons of opium in 2008.
World demand was estimated at about 4400 tons per year.
The Taliban this year are taking a passive stance toward cultivation and putting less pressure on Afghan farmers to plant opium poppy.
This then supports the current price.
Costa is an Italian diplomat who has served at the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime for 6 years.
