The Riyadh-based Naif Arab Academy for Security Sciences said in a statement that it was running a two-week workshop for 50 anti-terrorism experts.
On 5 January 2002 pan-Arab anti-terror academy Naif Arab Academy for Security Sciences reopened for the first time since the September 2001 terror attacks on the US.
Naif Arab Academy for Security Sciences is based in Riyadh.
Naif Arab Academy for Security Sciences is run by an Arab Interior Ministers' Council.
In a statement Naif Arab Academy for Security Sciences announced --
It will sponsor a 2-week workshop for 50 anti-terrorism experts.
The workshop's anti-terrorism experts are from 11 Arab countries including Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Mauritania, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.
The workshop's anti-terrorism experts belong to anti-terror squads in Arab security agencies and Anti-Organized Crime Units.
Some specialize in dealing with kidnapping and hostage-taking scenarios.
The workshop will address several terrorism-related issues including political factors leading to terror, the role of religion in fighting terrorists and economic factors that support crime and terrorism.
The workshop will study the use of the Internet to promote terrorism and the Internet's role in facilitating money transactions and funding terrorist groups.
In April 1998 Arab countries signed an anti-terrorism agreement that binds the signatories to coordinate to fight terrorism.

A United Nation nuclear team will make a week-long visit to North Korea this weekend to inspect the Stalinist state's controversial nuclear site.
Government sources said on January 7, 2002 that a united nation nuclear team will make a week-long visit to North Korea this weekend to inspect the Stalinist state's controversial nuclear site.
The upcoming visit is viewed as part of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) drive to clarify North Korea's nuclear ambitions.
A government source stated the visit by a group of IAEA safety experts is scheduled to last for a week beginning January 12, 2002.
The source stated that the inspection would focus on an isotope production laboratory in the Yongbyon nuclear complex which is north of North Korea's capital Pyongyang.
The IAEA tour of the isotope production laboratory will unlikely give a full picture of North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons ambitions.
The tour was a surprise offer made by North Korea in November 2001.
IAEA accepted North Korea's proposal last month but cautioned that the proposal is not a breakthrough.
IAEA also stated the lab is not one of the frozen facilities it wants to look into.
IAEA is based in Vienna and is the UN's nuclear supervisor.
North Korea has denied the IAEA full access to its facilities.
North Korea froze its suspected nuclear weapons program at Yongbyon in exchange for receiving two nuclear reactors producing less weapons-grade plutonium under a 1994 accord with the United States.
The 4.6-billion-dollar project was due to be completed by 2003.
Delays have pushed back the finish until at least 2008.
Pyongyang insists it will allow full IAEA inspections only when a significant portion of the project as defined in the 1994 accord is completed.

South Koreans rallied on January 11, 2002 in support of their right to eat dog meat.

South Koreans rallied on January 11, 2002 in support of their right to eat dog meat.
They threatened an Internet war as part of a campaign to defend the traditional cuisine.
A nationalist group has vowed cyber hostilities against U.S. based media company Warner Bros. and one of France's state-run television channels.
The activists accuse the organizations of being culturally-biased and insulting.
A South Korean group has announced a campaign backed by food scientists to promote the eating of dog meat.
This announcement was in response to increasing foreign criticism of the way dogs are slaughtered in South Korea.
The killing of dogs for restaurants has become a more popular topic than the football World Cup finals.
The World Cup finals are to be co-hosted by South Korea and Japan this year.
The debate was partly fueled by FIFA, football's international governing body.
FIFA urged South Korea to prevent the inhumane killing of dogs.
South Koreans are angered by the international pressure on their traditional cuisine.
The organizers of South Korean website antijapan.wo.ro vowed to paralyze the websites of Warner Bros. (www.wpix.com) and the French state television network (www.francetv.fr) on January 19, 2002.
The organizers of the South Korean website accused the broadcasters of falsely describing South Koreans and their food culture as barbaric.
The anti-Japan group stated that South Korean culture is under attack.
The statement was made to gain supporters to join the lobbying.
Cyber warfare has become a common weapon for South Koreans.
They are one of the most Internet savvy nations in the world.
South Korean cyber campaigners disabled Japanese education ministry websites last year in a protest against history books accused of skimming Japan's wartime record in Asia.
The nationalist group was formed to campaign against Japan.
The group said the foreign broadcasters are battering the eating dogmeat culture and that it is insulting behavior.
It tramples on a tradition of one country.
The group said the foreign broadcasters do not show any remorse for their culture of eating snails and horses.
The cyber attack is to show the power of South Koreans and Asians against the West's sense of superiority and ignorance of South Korea's history.
Another group said they will launch an association next Monday of around 100 dog meat restaurant owners in the Seoul region and hold a seminar to promote the dish.
Food scientist at Chung Chong College an Yong-geun said he would introduce some 350 different kinds of culinary art with dog meat.
French actress-turned activist Brigitte Bardot and other animal rights campaigners call to stop the South Korean practice of eating dogs.
FIFA president Sepp Blatter sent a letter last November to South Korea's World Cup organizing committee calling for immediate and decisive measures against cruelty to dogs.
It was ahead of the World Cup which starts May 31, 2002.
Head of the Korean Football Association and a FIFA vice president Chung Mong-Joon said FIFA should not intervene in the eating habits of a sovereign nation.
South Korean officials said most dogs used for eating were killed instantly by electrocution.
Activists contend many slaughterhouses in the countryside are not controlled.
They strangle dogs, hang them by a rope and beat them in line with traditional practice to make the meat more tender.
Dog restaurants were told to close or go into the backstreets when Seoul hosted the 1988 Olympics.
No similar move is planned for the World Cup.
The authorities say the practice is slowly disappearing in Korea.
A recent survey stated that about one million dogs are sold every year for food in South Korea and 92 percent of men aged 20 and above and 68 percent of adult women have tasted dog meat.

Religious extremism continues in Pakistan despite the banning of militant groups.
Religious extremism continues in Pakistan despite the banning of militant groups by the Pakistani Government.
Newspapers and magazines extolling the virtues of Islamic holy war in Kashmir continue to fill the newstands in Pakistan despite the Pakistani military Government's attempt at a large scale containment of religious extremism.
Around 1400 alleged religious extremists have been arrested since 020112 under severe actions against Islamic militants and sectarian radicals announced by President Pervez Musharraf during the weekend.
The severe actions against militants and radicals came as Pervez Musharraf banned 5 Islamic groups.
The banned 5 Islamic groups included the 2 hardline militant groups fighting Indian rule in Kashmir which the Indian government accuses of staging the violent 011213 attack on the Indian parliament.
Pakistani authorities have stated that no statements or literature from the 5 banned Islamic groups would be tolerated after Pervez Musharraf's speech banning the 5 Islamic groups.
Pervez Musharraf's speech banning the 5 Islamic groups was applauded by the United States.
Iftikhar Ahmed stated that under the notification that was issued late at night on 020114 all publications, newspapers, weekly magazines, monthlies, etc of the 5 banned Islamic groups are banned and confiscated.
Iftikhar Ahmed is a Pakistani interior ministry official.
Iftikhar Ahmed stated that Pakistan's provincial governments have been asked to implement the orders in the notification that was issued on 020114 and that Pakistan's provincial governments are in the process of taking action.
Karachi police chief Tariq Jamil stated that the 5 banned Islamic groups would not be allowed to operate in any way.
Tariq Jamil stated that he would examine if the baned literature is still available in the market despite the ban.
The 2 hardline militant groups fighting Indian rule in Kashmir are the Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad.
The Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad are still distributing their message through a range of publications and magazines easily available in Karachi.
Other groups linked to terrorism and included on the United States Terrorist Exclusion List are also publishing regular newspapers and journals containing rhetoric that is against Western countries and calls for war in the name of Islam.
Qari Mohammad Zafar stated that his elders urged him to read about Jihad through the Islam daily published by the Al-Rashid Trust and Lashkar-i-Taiba's zarb-e-Taiba weekly.
Qari Mohammad Zafar is an 18-year-old student of a religious seminary.
Qari Mohammad Zafar stated that he did not know whether the Pakistani government will also ban the publications encouraging Jihad.
Qari Mohammad Zafar stated that himself and other people have been told by our elders to read pro-Jihad newspapers and magazines.
The al-Rashid Trust and Lashkar-i-Taiba are on the United States Terrorist Exclusion List and the Al-Rashid Trust's and Lashkar-i-Taiba's assets frozen in Pakistan.
The Al-Rashid Trust has not been officially banned in Pakistan.
The primary editorial in The Islam daily of Al-Rashid Trust on 020115 carried a warning to the Pakistani government.
The Islam daily of Al-Rashid Trust supports the Taliban Fund linked to Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network.
The headline in the Islam daily of Al-Rashid Trust on 020115 stated action extreme against extremism above an article stating that the Pakistani government should not domineer a large section of Pakistani society which supported the jihad against Indian rule in the divided Himalayan state of Kashmir.
Newspaper seller Mohammad Farooq stated that Pervez Musharraf's clamp-down on extremism had done little to limit the demand for banned religious extremist publications.
Mohammad Farooq stated that the publication of the Islam daily of Al-Rashid Trust has not been affected yet by Pervez Musharraf's clamp-down on extremism and the circulation of the Islam daily of Al-Rashid Trust has increased in the past couple of days.
Over 12 publications including dailies, weeklies and monthlies of various extremist groups including those banned on 020112 still sell in large numbers in the markets and bazaars of Karachi.
Police officer Mohammad Iqbal stated that the police so far have not received any instructions to take action against any banned religious extremist publications.
Analysts stated that the Pakistani government may have trouble explaining the Pakistani government's reasoning if the banned religious extremist groups' publications are suddenly removed from the newsstands because the Pakistani Government generally supports the freedom of the press.
A reporter who did not want to be named from the publication of the Islam daily of Al-Rashid Trust stated that it would not be easy for the Pakistani government to ban the religious extremist publications and make over 500 employees jobless.

The Iranian army launched a huge sweep against traffickers along the borders with Afghanistan and Pakistan.
The radio said the first day of Val Fajr accumulated more than four tons of drugs and 50 guns in southeast Iran on January 16, 2002.
Val Fajr means swear to victory in Arabic and is a phrase from the Koran.
In December 2002 police announced than an armed corps with Afghanistan, Pakistan and Turkmenistan was being assembled specifically to combat drug trafficking along Iran's borders.
Iran is a major transit point between drug producers in Afghanistan and Pakistan and the markets of Europe and the Gulf.
Parliament approved plans in May 2001 to build an anti-drugs wall along the 925-kilometre (560-mile) border with Afghanistan.
A budget was allocated for the barrier to be equipped with electronic detention equipment.
An Afghan television reported on January 16, 2002 that Afghanistan's interim administration has banned the cultivation of opium poppies in a bid to end drug trafficking.
In July 2000 the Taliban militia also banned production of opium.
Opium is the raw ingredient for heroin.
The ban was strictly enforced with opium production decreasing from 3,200 tons to 185 tons.
Afghan farmers resumed growing opium poppies after the militia was overthrown in December 2001.
Iranian law states the death penalty for drug trafficking.
More than 3,000 policemen have been killed in anti-drugs raids in the past 20 years.

Canadian government's warning of al-Qaeda's capability to launch a cyberattack causes various industries to review their preparedness.
Critical infrastructures including energy and transportation providers cite close work with Government to remain aware of threats and to update accordingly.
A recent government warning that al-Qaeda terrorists could launch a cyberattack on Canadian interests or critical infrastructure has caused many concerned industries to review their security systems.
Vice President of Canadian electricity Association Francis Bradley stated that the company has a warning system for both physical and cyberattacks.
Bradley stated that the company has been significantly focused on prevention of cyberattacks.
In a recent interview Bradley stated that many utility firms perform a brief review of their multi-tiered response systems after such warnings are issued.
The warning from the Canadian Department of National Defense's office of critical infrastructure protection and emergency service was quietly released on 20 December 2001 and cited no specific threat.
Director of threat analysis at the Canadian Department of National Defense's office of critical infrastructure protection and emergency service Brenda hensler-Hobbs stated that following the attacks of 11 September 2001 the Canadian Government specifically examined the potential cyber-capability of al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden's followers.
Hensler-Hobbs stated that the Canadian government has no knowledge of Al-Qaeda having engaged in cyberattacks in the past but that leader bin Laden has suggested that if he chose to launch cyberattacks he could have the means available to him.
In summary of the recent warning stating that such an attack could be executed in the very near future hensler-Hobbs stated that bin Laden's location was irrelevant because bin Laden possesses the money and supporters necessary to have such an attack executed by others.
A number of al-Qaeda militants including Millennium plot bomber Ahmed Ressam are known to have remained in Canada.
Many are located in Montreal.
Hensler-Hobbs stated that the proliferation and availability of Hacker tools and the low skill level needed to conduct cyberattacks demonstrate the ease of launching an attack anywhere.
Hensler-Hobbs cited the example of the Montreal-based Hacker known as mafiaboy who attacked U.S. websites including Amazon.com in 2000.
Many think that security must be improved at North American critical infrastructures including energy and transportation providers and the financial services sector that are largely interconnected.
Many businesses began preparing for cyber incidents before the year 2000.
A separate report issued recently by the U.S. government-funded research group computer science and telecommunications Board stated that cyber security needs considerable improvement.
For example, according to a Canadian government estimate the love bug launched in May 2000 caused 6.7 billion U.S. dollars in damage and disrupted Canadian government systems.
Bell Canada spokesman Andrew Cole stated that Bell Canada is prepared and remains prepared for various potential situations and scenarios.
Cole stated --
Bell Canada works very closely with the Government and the private sector to be aware of security concerns and to update accordingly.
Bell Canada worked closely with U.S. officials and firms after the attacks of 11 September 2001.
Bell Canada provides a total of 26 million phone and Internet connections to a nation of 30 million people.
Bradley stated --
Electricity firms have strong warning systems that are coordinated by the North American Electric reliability Council.
There has not been a cyber event that has resulted in a loss of power for utility customers.
There is little possibility that a cyberattack would disable a North American electric grid.
Electric companies are well prepared and are making all preparations required to be ready for any physical or cyberattack.
The North American Electric reliability Council's 30 largest utility companies went on their highest alert on September 11 and many still have an increased security presence in effect and plan to extend it further.

Russia's military authorities criticized Kamchatenergo Power Company for imposing a shutdown on supplies to a command center that guides military satellites in orbit and contributes to systems controlling the international space station.
The Kamchatenergo company disconnected a major control center of the Russian space forces located in Kamchatka early Saturday, the Russian Space Forces press service said.
Kamchatenergo feeds power to the vast Kamchatka peninsula in Russia's far east.
A statement from the Russian Space Forces press services on 020126 called the action a direct violation of government decrees on defense facilities and stated that it could have led to the loss of a spacecraft costing hundreds of millions of rubles.
The monitoring center is a key element in maintaining Russia's satellite network in orbit and plays a part in operations of the international space platform Alfa.
Officials at the command center took urgent measures to use reserve power units to keep the system functioning and to temporarily provide residential centers with electricity.
Several other military bases and strategic defense units were affected.
The State power monopoly United energy services and its regional subsidiary Kamchatenergo launched a program of power cuts to long-term debtors on 020125.
United energy services argues that non-payment of bills has prevented it from maintaining supplies.
The Russian Space Forces, the space branch of Russia's armed forces, expressed alarm at the prospect of further power cuts resulting from delays in Federal budget resources reaching local authorities on time.

28 January 2002 -- Russian space officials warned that power cuts against the military for non-payment of bills could have catastrophic consequences.
Russian space agency spokesman Sergei Gorbunov announced --
A weekend black-out at a command center in the Far East Kamchatka Peninsula of the Russian space forces had not affected the international space station (ISS).
The Kamchatka Command Center maintains Russia's satellite network in orbit.
The Kamchatka command center plays a role in ISS operations.
cutting power to command centers could pose dangers for Russian space installations.
Power cuts could lead to a failure of all work with space craft.
The ISS could function for an orbit or two without ground control by using standby systems.
A total unexpected loss of power during control of military equipment could be catastrophic.
The Government or UES or the Ministry of Defense must resolve the issue.
The Kamchatenergo company feeds power to Kamchatka Peninsula.
On 26 January 2002 Kamchatenergo disconnected the Russian Space Forces center for most of the day.
Kamchatenergo is 1 of several regional subsidiaries of State power monopoly United energy services (UES).
On 25 January 2002 UES cut power to long-term debtors.
Kamchatenergo stated that non-payment of bills prevent it from maintaining power supplies.

An Australian jury found that an Uzbekistan Olympic boxing official was defamed in a book about alleged Olympic corruption in which he was depicted as a major international heroin dealer and racketeer.
A New South Wales Supreme Court jury took just over 2 hours on 020201 to find Gafur Rakhimov had been libelled in a book the Great Olympic swindle which alleges Olympic corruption.
Gafur Rakhimov is an Uzbekistan Olympic boxing official and was depicted in the book as a major international heroin dealer and racketeer.
The Great Olympic swindle was written by British journalist Andrew Jennings and published by Simon and Schuster.
The Rakhimov case will now go to a single judge to hear defences and decide any damages to be awarded to Rakhimov.
The Great Olympic swindle implied that Gafur Rakhimov had been engaged in fraud, prostitution, assassination, gun running and plutonium smuggling.
The book also implied that the businessman was a gangster in the Soviet black economy and had traded sporting medals for bribes.
Rakhimov was Vice-President of the Olympic Council of Asia and an Executive Member of the International Amateur Boxing Association.
Rakhimov was also said to have bribed members of the International Amateur Boxing Federation in the vote for the Federation Presidency.
Jennings is a long-time critic of the International Olympic Committee.
The 020201 verdict followed 2 defamation actions brought last year by Rakhimov against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and Jennings and against the Sydney Morning Herald (SMH) and Jennings.
A jury found in the case involving the ABC that ABC's flagship current affairs program four corners had implied Rakhimov knew some of the world's most dangerous criminals and was suspected by the FBI of drug trafficking.
That Panel found those insinuations were not defamatory and threw out the case against the ABC and Jennings.
The SMH and Jennings were then sued over 3 articles published in the lead-up to the 000000 Olympics.
The jury in that case found Rakhimov had been painted as a major international criminal and had been defamed.

OSCE urges permanent end to Afghan terrorism and drug-trafficking to create long-term stability in Central Asia.
Expert states that cultivation of opium and drug trafficking are deeply entrenched in Afghanistan and will be impossible to eradicate.
On 10 February 2002 an official with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe was quoted as stating that long-term stability in Central Asia depends on eradicating post-Taliban Afghan terrorism and drug-trafficking.
The OSCE envoy in neighboring Tajikistan Marc Gilbert stated to the government weekly national gazette that there are now hopes that Afghanistan will develop its democratic institutions and end terrorism and drug-smuggling resulting in greater stability in Central Asia.
Gilbert stated that the post-Soviet republics in central Asia fought terrorism by giving material and other necessary help to the international anti-terrorist coalition in the war against Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden and the Taliban regime.
Both Tajikistan and Uzbekistan share a border with Afghanistan and have experienced raids by Taliban-backed Islamic militants in recent years.
Neighboring Kyrgyzstan has also experienced raids by Taliban-backed Islamic militants in recent years.
Kazakhstan also became a key U.S. partner in the Afghan war opening its airspace to military overflights.
Turkmenistan maintained a more neutral stance.
Turkmenistan borders Afghanistan.
Gilbert stated that Tajikistan's positive and responsible approach to the crisis in Afghanistan has significantly improved the country's image internationally.
Tajik government expert and head of the Tajik Drug Control Agency Vladimir Rakhmonov stated on 10 February 2002 that the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan had failed to stop drug trafficking across the border into Tajikistan.
Rakhmonov stated to Interfax --
Opium and heroin are a form of hard-currency reserve for Afghanistan.
Drug trafficking from Afghanistan has been concealed so securely that it will be impossible to uncover.
Drug trafficking from Afghanistan resumed during a brief hiatus in the anti-terrorist operation.
In 2001 Tajik law-enforcement agencies and Russian border guards seized 8.8 tons of drugs including 4.2 tons of heroin.
This represented a 26 percent increase overall in 2001 with 3 times the amount of heroin.
Suggestions that there are no longer drug lords in Afghanistan and that drug traffic into Tajikistan has been eradicated are unrealistic and false.
Many years would be needed to convert Afghanistan's agriculture historically specialized in the growing of raw opium.
Cultivation of raw opium provided the only source of income for much of the rural population.
Tajikistan's 780-mile border with Afghanistan is patrolled by approximately 11000 Russian soldiers under a 1992 agreement between the Russian and Tajik Governments.

Afghan officials conducted talks with Russian officials asking for assistance in stopping Afghanistan's large illegal opium and heroin trade.
Afghanistan seeks to end poppy harvesting and increase border control.
March 1, 2002 interim interior minister of Afghanistan Yunus Qanooni asked Russian officials to assist in combating the drugs trade and establishing security in Afghanistan.
Qanooni is a member of the Northern Alliance.
Qanooni told Russian Deputy Minister for Emergency Situations Yury Vorobyov --
Unfortunately over the past six years, the rule of the Taliban turned Afghanistan into a center of terrorism and drugs.
The struggle against terrorism and against drugs, and the establishment of security is a priority for the Administration of Afghanistan.
But combating terrorism and drugs requires joint efforts.
Peace and stability in Afghanistan is not only in the interests of the Afghani people and nation but of all the countries in the region.
Afghanistan's interim government stated that it would take firm measures very quickly to prevent the harvest of poppy in the wake of the Taliban regime's fall late last year.
Leader of Afghanistan's interim government Hamid Karzai said the fight against poppy harvesting and the lucrative trafficking of opium and heroin will be a top priority.
The anti-drug effort is strongly supported by Western countries, whose populations are a major market for heroin and opium from Afghanistan.
February 28, 2002 Kabul officials announced that Afghan police are creating their first anti-narcotics units with the help of the United Nations due to concern that the country could again become a major producer of opium.
February 28, 2002 Qanooni stated in talks with Russian Interior Minister Boris Gryzlov that Afghanistan's main task is to prevent future drugs production.
Qanooni outlined a three-stage plan of action --
Afghan authorities will seek to ban poppy harvesting.
Afghan authorities will strengthen the borders around Afghanistan.
Afghan authorities will cooperate with the security forces of neighboring states.
Afghanistan is thought to be responsible for 75 percent of the world's opium and 80 percent of the heroin traded illegally in Europe.
Approximately 11000 Russian guards patrol the 1200-kilometre (750-mile) border between Russia and Afghanistan under a 1992 agreement signed by Moscow and Dushanbe.
The Northern Alliance opposes the Taliban but tolerated the harvest of poppy in territory it controlled.
Afghanistan's interim government has been in power for 2 months.

South Korea's defense ministry under attack in parliament over allegations it is favoring U.S. company Boeing for multi-billion-dollar fighter project.
Newspaper reports reveal that French-made plane was rated higher in air force evaluations and that the Government is instead responding to political pressure from the U.S. and Boeing.
South Korea's Defense Ministry came under attack in Parliament on 04 March 2002 over allegations that it is favoring U.S. company Boeing for a multi-billion-dollar fighter project.
Ruling and opposition lawmakers criticized the Ministry as newspapers reported that the French-made fighter Rafale had scored the highest marks of any of the 4 contenders in field tests performed by South Korean Air Force evaluators.
The 3.2 billion U.S. dollar project to buy 40 fighters will be one of the most important international military contracts awarded this year but it has encountered multiple obstacles.
Award of the contract was temporarily suspended in February 2002 after the prices offered by 4 bidders were judged too high.
South Korea's defense ministry promised to conclude its first-stage appraisal by the end of March 2002.
There has also been much newspaper speculation that the South Korean government might yield to U.S. pressure to buy Boeing's aged F-15 k.
Speculation grew in February 2002 when Defense Minister Kim Dong-Shin stressed that South Korea should consider security ties with the United States in the project.
The other competing planes are the Dassault firm's Rafale, the Eurofighter Consortium's typhoon 2000 and the Russian Su-32 made by Sukhoi.
Dassault is seeking its first foreign order for the Rafale.
Kang Chang-Sung of the opposition Grand National Party expressed doubt of the fairness of the evaluation methods stating that his party suspects that the Defense Ministry has political reasons to select the F-15 k.
The ruling Millennium Democratic Party also accused the Ministry of favoring the F-15 k despite the defense chief's insistence that there was no favoritism toward Boeing.
Kim stated --
There has been no pressure from the United States.
There would be an investigation into how classified documents had been leaked.
The Defense Ministry was further pressured by numerous newspaper reports of the Air Force's evaluation of the Rafale as excellent in all categories.
Newspapers stated that the F-15 k was rated excellent in reliability and support combat capability but met only 30 percent of core technology requirements.
Newspapers stated that the Eurofighter was rated excellent in general function and reliability categories but the Rafale also earned the excellent rating for its weapons and electronic warfare capability.
The Su-35 placed fourth with ratings of ordinary in all five categories.
Rafale reportedly offered more generous terms for technology transfer and subcontracts for South Korea's aerospace industry.
The Ministry stated that the air force was just 1 of 4 evaluations.
Some analysts have stated that the study method is biased toward Boeing noting that the evaluation was revised in February 2002 to ensure that all 4 bidders would receive an automatic 60 points for technology transfer.
The English-language Korea Herald newspaper stated that this revision gives an advantage to Boeing which has been reluctant to transfer core technology.
The Korea Herald stated that when evaluators were conducting their first-stage reports the ministry ordered them to give each bidder grades within a range of 60 to 100 points instead of 0 to 100 points.
The Korea Herald stated that critics say Boeing would benefit most from the points minimum because it would gain fewer points than Dassault in terms of technology transfer and subcontracts.

A senior South Korean minister on Friday warned that there could be a new crisis this year over inspections of the rival North's nuclear program.
Senior South Korean minister Jeong Se-hyun on 020329 warned that tensions could rise because North Korea wants inspections of its nuclear facilities delayed.
Unification Minister Jeong is the South Korean government's chief policymaker for relations with North Korea.
Jeong said in a lecture on South Korea and US relations with North Korea that there was some talk in the United States that the nuclear inspection in North Korea should be carried out in 020800.
North Korea's suggestion is that the inspection should be delayed until 050000.
Jeong said that a crisis could come in 020800 on the Korean peninsula if this issue becomes an international point of contention.
Following Jeong's comments another senior government official sought to play down Jeong's remarks about the looming troubles.
The unnamed official told the Yonhap national news agency that talk of pressing for IAEA inspections in 020800 had come only from private researchers in the United States.
The official said it was speculation that the North Korean government thinks the inspections should be delayed until 050000.
Top South Korean envoy Lim Won-dong intends to raise international concerns about the North's nuclear and missile programs when he goes to Pyongyang 020403.
Lim is a special advisor to President Kim Dae-jung on national security and foreign affairs.
Lim has also warned of a looming nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula.
Military officials said Lim intimated the problems could be as serious as a 940000 nuclear standoff over North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development that came close to conflict.
The North Korean government agreed to freeze the North Korean nuclear program under an accord with a US-led international consortium.
The consortium is to build 2 light water nuclear reactors that produce less weapons grade fuel than North Korea's old graphite reactors and provide substitute fuel until they are built.
The original 030000 target date for completion has been put back at least 5 years because of major political and construction delays.
The 940000 Accord stipulated that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) must be allowed to inspect North Korea's old facilities to see if plutonium has been processed before the core facilities of the new reactors are installed.

Mohanty stated that Hindustan Aeronautics Limited will fund the initial investment from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited's own resources and the 500 million United States dollars needed for tooling, other equipment and technical assistance will be raised when Hindustan Aeronautics Limited needs it.
Hindustan Aeronautics Limited has paid a licence fee of 286 million United States dollars to Russia to be able to make the Sukhoi 30 MK fighter jets.
N. R. Mohanty stated that the Indian government was also planning to purchase 50 Sukhoi 30 MK fighter jets from Russia at a cost of 30 million United States dollars each.
N. R. Mohanty stated that Hindustan Aeronautics Limited's indigenous aircraft will cost slightly less or be almost equal to 30 million United States dollars each.
An earlier 340 million United States dollar plan to upgrade India's MiG-21 fighter jets was delayed by more than 5 years.
Russian officials blamed the Indian Government's intransigence for the delay.
The 960000 Russian Indian upgrade deal was meant to be completed within 2 years but the first 2 upgraded MiG-21-93 jets were not delivered to India until 000000.
N. R. Mohanty stated that Hindustan Aeronautics Limited's 010000 target was to deliver 16 MiG-21 upgrades but Hindustan Aeronautics Limited was only able to deliver 6.
N. R. Mohanty stated that Hindustan Aeronautics Limited had many problems with the French and Russian companies and that this year Hindustan Aeronautics Limited is planning a minimum of 24 upgrades.
N. R. Mohanty stated that Hindustan Aeronautics Limited had submitted a proposal to the Indian government for the development of a light attack helicopter and the first flight of India's intermediate jet trainer hjt-36 was planned for 020000.
Hindustan Aeronautics Limited stated on 020404 that Hindustan Aeronautics Limited made a net profit of 62 million United States dollars on a sales turnover of 27.3 billion rupees year-on-year for the fiscal year to 020300.

The number of heroin addicts in Tajikistan has vastly increased over the past five years due to drug trafficking between Afghanistan and Russia and Europe.
The number of heroin addicts in Tajikistan has vastly increased over the past five years due to drug trafficking between Afghanistan and Europe.
The majority of the heroin is grown in neighboring Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is the world's top opium producer.
Tajikistan shares a 1300-kilometer (800-mile) border with Afghanistan and has become a transit point for heroin being trafficked into Russia and Europe.
In 2001 the Russian army and Tajik police confiscated nearly 9 tons of drugs and arrested more than 2000 people.
The Russian army guards Tajikistan's border with Afghanistan.
The majority of Tajikistan's heroin addicts live in cities and are aged between 18 and 25.
75 percent of Tajikistan's population lives in rural areas, where heroin addicts are frequently ostracized.
Head of a public drug clinic in Dushanbe, Tajikistan Andrei Onishchenko, stated --
There are 5000 heroin addicts officially registered in Tajikistan, compared with 57 in 1997.
The actual figure is seven times greater than the official number.
The low cost and availability of heroin are among the causes of the addiction problem.
One dose of heroin costs less than a dollar in Tajikistan, which is less than the price of a bottle of the local vodka.
an addict who has been using heroin for 2 years needs to use 3 grams of heroin every 24 hours.
3 grams of heroin costs 70 somonis or 30 dollars.
an addict is willing to commit any crime to pay for heroin.
Afghan heroin is the strongest in the world because it is made from poppies cultivated at high altitudes and therefore subjected to high doses of ultra-violet light.
A person who takes a daily dose of Afghan heroin has a life expectancy of between 5 and 7 years and many commit suicide before that.
The Tajik State pays 25 dirams (a few cents) per day for every person in the rehabilitation clinics.
The percentage of relapses is very high due to the lack of followup treatment and unemployment among young people.
Head of a Tajik government agency that fights drug trafficking Avaz yuldachev stated that heroin users are ill and need treatment.
Anvar, a 14-year-old boy from Dushanbe, used heroin for three years before being hospitalized in Onishchenko's drug clinic.
Anvar said --
He sniffed a white substance he found in his backyard and was unable to stop.
He stopped going to school.
He stole from the local market to get money for more heroin.
Drug traffickers face the death penalty under Tajik law.
Tajikistan has 6.2 million inhabitants.

On 22 May 2002 officials stated that Taiwan National Chen Chi Tien was executed by firing squad in Vietnam's 8th execution of a foreigner.
Chen was sentenced to death in 1997 for the illegal manufacture of methamphetamines disguised as a soap manufacturing plant.
Court officials in the commercial capital stated that Chen was executed in Ho Chi Minh City on 21 May 2002.
The businessman was arrested with several Vietnamese accomplices in 1995 after 170 kilograms (375 pounds) of methamphethamine chlorohydrate were found stored in the downtown soap factory Chen had established in 1994.
Police established that Chen had already exported at least 4 shipments of the drug before his illegal manufacturing operation was discovered.
Chen traveled to Vietnam regularly since 1992.
The crystalline amphetamine derivative is Smokable and has a very large illegal market in East Asia.
The drug is also known as ice or shabu.
Vietnam has executed 1 Western national to date.

AFP, members of international and local press, and United Nations representatives and diplomats witnessed Myanmar destroy illicit drugs the authorities captured.
Min said Myanmar would be one of the richest countries in the region if they were as corrupt as outsiders claimed.
Hla Min stated that illicit drugs worth some 50 billion dollars have been destroyed by authorities since 1974.
Min said it was enough to pay Myanmar's national debt ten times over.
Drug-burning ceremonies are regular events in Myanmar.
Critics argue that it does not reflect the massive drug industry in the country.
Resident Representative of the UN's Drug Control Program (UNDCP) Jean-Luc Lemahieu said this one is different.
Almost 102 tons of poppy seeds were burnt in the capital of Myanmar's northern Shan state at this ceremony.
The ceremony also included 249 kilograms of opium, 102 kilograms of morphine powder, three kilograms of solid morphine and various precursor chemicals.
Lemahieu said that this ceremony had less processed opium and heroin than opium seeds.
It made it more symbolic and indicated the willingness of those directly involved to eliminate the opium.
The destruction forms part of the Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control's project new destiny.
It aims to prevent poppy cultivation by distributing seeds for substitution crops.
Farmers have been asked to grow seven kinds of alternative crops across 21,969 acres (8,891 hectares) of land instead of opium.
Global narcotics authorities declared Myanmar the world's largest producer of opium in 2001.
They accounted for as much as 60 percent of global supply.
Myanmar beat Afghanistan because the Taliban militia's enforced ban on opium poppies decreased Afghan production by 90 percent.
Critics said the Myanmar regime overlooks much of the production and trafficking in drugs by ethnic insurgent groups.
In particular the largest armed drug militia in the world the United Wa State Army.
Myanmar's Home Minister Colonel Tin Hlaing said the success of project new destiny is evidenced by the tons of poppy seeds that have been turned in rather than seized.
Hlaing stated his confidence in the drug scourge that threatens the world will not find a place in Myanmar if the local population is committed to this sort of cooperation.
Lauk Kai is one of the regime's showpieces for its previous crop substitution programs.
It has expanses of rubber trees, fruit orchards and paddy where poppies used to thrive.
The poppies yielded the raw ingredient for heroin.
Lauk Kai is located in the infamous Golden Triangle.
Reformed drug lord and leader of the Kokang phone Kyar Shin pledged commitment to the government program.
The Kokang comprise the majority of the population in Myanmar.
Phone Kyar Shin predicts that starting today there will be no destruction ceremony in the future because no more poppy will be grown.
Phone Kyar Shin said this at another ceremony that destroyed more than 12 tons of poppy seed.
Phone Kyar Shin appealed for help from the international community.
The international community is reluctant to give help.
Phone Kyar Shin requested the distinguished guests to understand Myanmar's situation more and give practical advice and support.
UNDCP's Lemahieu when asked by AFP what impact project New Destiny had on the international community hoped it would have a positive impact and that some additional funds would come forward.
Lemahieu said so much depends on the political situation in this country.
There is hope for further political change following the May 6 release of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi from 19 months house arrest.
The regime seeks the United States approval for the project.
Its global announcement comes via the regime's newly-appointed public relations firm in Washington.
The US charge d'affaires Priscilla Clapp said maybe because it has to be a multi-faceted, sustained effort for it to work and that there should be measurable results.

Ecological organization Greenpeace stated on June 21, 2002 that Russia helped Iran to develop nuclear weapons by building Iran's Bushehr atomic power station.
The Russian branch of Greenpeace distributed a report at a press conference of Russia's atomic energy ministry.
The ministry conceded that the Russo-Iranian accord on the plant's construction does not require the repatriation of the nuclear fuel.
The report stated that the recycling of nuclear fuel from Bushehr is not mentioned in the accord between the Russian and Iranian governments on the construction of the plant.
Greenpeace member Vladimir Chuprov said the ministry had practically admitted that Iran will not return to Russia the spent nuclear fuel from the power station and Russia's only use for Iran is to equip itself with nuclear weapons.
The atomic energy ministry confirmed the report's existence and strongly denied Greenpeace's accusations.
Ministry spokesman Nikolai Shingarev told AFP that Russia would only supply nuclear fuel to Iran on condition that it be returned to Russia after its use.
Shingarev said Russia is currently in negotiations with Iran.
This issue will be settled before the power station comes into operation.
Shingarev said the accord on Bushehr was signed before Russia passed a law permitting the import of nuclear waste last year.
This explains why the accord makes no mention of the return of the fuel.
Shingarev said it is very difficult to make a nuclear weapon from the plutonium in this fuel.
The United States and Israel fear that the Russian-Iranian nuclear cooperation could enable Tehran to acquire the technology needed to build nuclear weapons.
Russia dismisses this accusation.
Iran ordered the power station in 1994 at a cost of nearly 800 million dollars (860 million euros) from Russia.
Iran has said the plant is being built only for civilian energy purposes and allows regular inspections of Bushehr by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Experts say Bushehr could in theory become operational as early as September 2003.
Currently it is equipped with a single reactor.
German group Siemens pulled out of the long-standing project at the request of the German government after Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution.
US President George W. Bush raised the US's concerns about Russian nuclear cooperation with Iran at the summit in Moscow last month between Bush and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.

Asian countries participated in United Nations International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking on 26 June 2002 by executing drug traffickers and burning narcotics worth 1 billion U.S. dollars.
Participating countries adopted tough positions in order to demonstrate commitment to eradicating the problem.
The China News Service reported that on 25 June 2002 14 people were sentenced to death in Chengdu, China and that 9 of those sentenced were immediately taken to the execution grounds and shot.
The China News Service report stated that in recent years in Chengdu the number of drug crimes has increased.
The report stated that the drug situation in Chengdu is becoming serious as drug criminals are establishing connections with criminals outside the province.
Chengdu is the capital of the southwest Sichuan Province.
At least 36 more drug criminals have been reported executed in China in the past week to mark World Anti-drugs day.
In total China executed at least 50 drug criminals as part of the observance.
Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri adopted a strict position calling for the death sentence for drug traffickers.
Megawati stated --
Life sentences and other prison sentences are no longer sufficient for those who distribute drugs.
No sentence is sufficient other than the death sentence.
The military junta of Myanmar burned narcotics it said were worth more than 1 billion U.S. dollars in its latest attempt to convince critics it is committed to eradicating their drug problem.
The junta accompanied by military pageant ignited an incinerator into which workers shoveled bags of heroin bricks and amphetamines.
Myanmar's top ruler Senior General Than Shwe and international diplomats attended the burning ceremony in Yangon.
3027 kilograms (6650 pounds) of opium, 240 kilograms of heroin, 434 kilograms of marijuana, 34.9 million amphetamine tablets, 4 million ephedrine tablets and 2865 kilograms of powdered ephedrine were burned.
Myanmar anti-drugs official Brigadier-General Zaw Win stated in a speech before the burning that the Myanmar government is aware of the serious threat that drugs pose and considers it a national duty to do all it can to eradicate the problem.
U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency officials helped conduct spot checks to verify the destruction.
Myanmar is the world's largest producer of illicit opium according to the latest U.S. State Department anti-narcotics report.
Myanmar is also the primary source of amphetamine-type stimulants in Asia.
Critics claim narcotics trade finances Myanmar's military government but the Government states it is doing all it can to restrict drug trade and wants more international help to do so.
In Thailand Princess ubolratana presided over the burning of more than 870 tons of seized drugs.
Health Minister Sudarat Keyuraphan reported to Princess ubolratana that the event was meant to demonstrate the Government's strong determination to eradicate the drug problem.
In Kabul on 25 June 2002 the Head of the United Nations Drug Control Program (UNDCP) Bernard Frahi stated --
War-torn Afghanistan continues to be the top supplier of heroin to Europe and the producer of almost all the opiates consumed in Central Asia.
Afghanistan is the source of approximately 70 to 90 per cent of the heroin found in European markets.
No country is immune from the issue of drug-abuse.
Newly-elected president of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai has vowed to eradicate poppy cultivation from Afghanistan.
In Cambodia several hundred people marched through the capital Phnom Penh to appeal for an end to growing drug use.
United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention official Bengt juhlin stated that people are uniting this day to demonstrate to the world a commitment to fighting drug abuse.
Juhlin stated that Cambodia's past reputation as 1 of the few Southeast Asian countries without a drug problem is no longer accurate as drug abuse in the country is rapidly increasing.

Indian government tests Russian rocket amid efforts to increase defense against possible Pakistani attacks.
Indian Defense Ministry has increased spending on defense purchases.
On 29 June 2009 Indian government test-fired the multiple-role Russian-made rocket system known as Smerch from a missile testing range in the eastern state of Orissa.
Officials said a contingent of Russian military experts was also at the site of the launch.
One Ministry official stated the smart rocket has a maximum range of 90 kilometers (56 miles) and is capable of striking targets in the air or on land.
Indian government has developed an array of guided and ballistic missiles and is reportedly experimenting with a maritime cruise missile that can carry nuclear warheads.
Indian Defense Secretary Yogendra Narain stated --
There is a missile threat to India.
Indian government is giving top priority to a system for missile defense.
Indian government is simultaneously upgrading land and air surveillance systems.
Indian Defense Ministry has increased defense spending for new purchases by 33 percent.
There has been a sharp increase in Indian Defense Ministry's purchases of military hardware including night vision devices, unmanned aerial vehicles and other anti-terrorism devices.
Narain also stated the Indian Defense Ministry has sought government approval to allow the Ministry to carry forward unutilized military budgetary allocations from 1 fiscal year to another.
Narain stated that carrying forward the military budget was a long-standing convention in France and Italy.
The defense ministry has been criticized for not utilizing funds made available every year for acquisitions of latest equipment including the missile defense shield.
The Hindu newspaper stated Indian government had already acquired an early warning system to counter the threat of a missile attack by Pakistani government.
Narain stated on 28 June 2002 that Indian government had already acquired Israeli Green Pine radars that are capable of simultaneously track several in-flight missiles.
The Hindustan Times daily reported that India had petitioned Israeli Government to allow the Government of New Delhi to either buy or borrow the Israeli government's new Ofek-5 spy satellite and acquire Israel's Arrow anti-missile systems.
The Times reported that Israeli government rejected both requests and that Israeli government stated the Ofek-5 could not be moved from the satellite's Iran-Syria-Iraq trajectory and the Arrow was still being developed.
The Times also reported that Israeli defense ministry's director general Amos Yaron visited New Delhi twice last month in response to the Indian Defense Ministry's requests.
Narain did not reveal names of countries India is negotiating with to acquire the missile shield.
On 28 June 2002 Narain stated that New Delhi was discussing the issue with the United States.
Indian government's attempts to upgrade systems to counter missile attacks occurs as Indian and Pakistani governments have placed about 1 million troops on India-Pakistan borders since December 2001.
In May 2001 Pakistan test-fired 3 missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads.
Since independence from British rule in 1947 Indian and Pakistani governments have fought 2 of 3 wars over Kashmir.
Indian and Pakistani governments nearly engaged in a fourth conflict in 1999.
Indian and Pakistani governments each conducted nuclear tests in May 1998.

Malaysia proposes expansion of anti-terrorism pact with Indonesia and the Philippines to entire ASEAN.
Terrorism is expanding across Southeast Asia.
The Malaysian Government proposes the expansion of an anti-terrorism pact with Indonesia and the Philippines to encompass the remainder of Southeast Asia.
Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar stated that other members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will be encouraged to accede to the pact at talks next week with ASEAN foreign ministers in Brunei.
Syed Hamid stated that Thailand, Laos and Singapore had expressed interest in joining the pact.
Malaysian defense analyst dzirhan mahadzir stated --
Cooperation by poorer countries may be stymied by financial constraints and a perception that terrorism does not directly affect these countries.
An ASEAN pact is beneficial in the long-term but will be difficult to implement because national security issues and interstate rivalry may make some of ASEAN's 10 members wary to divulge information.
ASEAN must agree on a definition of terrorism to identify the common enemy.
20020500 senior ASEAN members Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines signed an anti-terror security pact intended to initiate the eradication of terrorism from the region.
The 3 countries share sea borders frequently used by pirates and criminals in evading pursuing troops.
The pact includes plans to trace and freeze terror funds and exchange information to curb cross-border piracy, drug trafficking, illegal entry and illegal trafficking of women and children.
Syed Hamid stated that after 20010911 countries should exchange information that may affect transnational crime such as funds of terrorists that may be kept in other countries or third party information to combat the greater threat of international terrorism.
Mushahid Ali of the Singapore-based Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies stated --
The trilateral pact between Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines constituted a constructive first step.
Indonesia and other ASEAN members must more proactively monitor terrorist activities and establish a concrete mechanism among national agencies for the protracted conflict.
20020500 ASEAN security ministers at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur failed to agree on a definition of terrorism but agreed to increase cooperation among State enforcement agencies and endorsed the use of detention without trial for suspected militants in Malaysia and Singapore.
Objections were raised concerning Malaysia's proposal to include State terrorism in the definition.
Dzirhan stated --
The agreement among Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines may have been aimed at ingratiating the countries to the US rather than combating terrorism.
Since the pact was signed no progress has occurred.
The creation of a formalized security structure in combating terror will be decelerated by the ASEAN's model of acting on consensus.
Officials stated that after the meeting in Brunei 20020728-20020801 ASEAN and its major western trading partners are expected to demand freezing of terror funds and stronger counter-terrorism cooperation.
Dozens of suspected terrorists allegedly linked to al-Qaeda in Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines have revealed the existence of a regional Islamic militant group called the Jemaah Islamiyah, which also operates in Indonesia.
Southeast Asia is now suspected as a potential new haven for al-Qaeda operatives escaping US and allied attacks in Afghanistan and elsewhere.

On 021015 officials stated that all Vietnam-based websites will require a license to operate in Vietnam in new Vietnamese government efforts to control the dissemination of reactionary or pornographic material online.
Do Quy Doan stated to Agence France-Presse that the newly-imposed website licensing rule seeks to prevent harmful information from threatening Vietnamese culture and national security.
Do Quy Doan is a spokesman for the Vietnamese Ministry of Culture and Information.
Do Quy Doan stated that the Vietnamese Ministry of Culture and Information will take 30 days to license eligible websites that do not include pornographic material, information that harms the national security or encourages violence and anti-government activities.
Diplomatic, foreign and press institutions must obtain permission from the Vietnamese Foreign Affairs Ministry before applying for licenses permitting them to distribute content online in Vietnam.
Do Quy Doan stated that any Vietnam-based website must clearly display the website licensing number and date on its homepage.
Writers and intellectuals in Vietnam have increasingly employed the Internet to distribute news or opinion banned from the tightly-controlled Vietnamese state press.
The number of Internet users in Vietnam is rapidly increasing and could reach 5 percent of its 79 million residents by 050000.
As of 020600 there were only 175000 registered Internet users in Vietnam.
Registered Internet users in Vietnam increased by 30 percent from 010000 to 020600.
Most Vietnamese gain Internet access via the Vietnam's 4,000-plus Internet cafes.
It is estimated that the number of people with online access in Vietnam may be as many as 1 million.

Atomic Energy Agency director States it would be difficult for Iraq to conceal a nuclear weapons program if international inspectors were allowed to return.
Inspectors would perform various tests, visits, and interviews and their presence alone in the country would be a deterrent.
On 18 October 2002 International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) director Mohamed ElBaradei stated it is unlikely that Iraq could conceal a nuclear weapons program if it allowed international inspectors to return.
ElBaradei stated that once inspectors were working in Iraq their presence alone would be a deterrent to developing nuclear weapons.
ElBaradei stated to reporters at his headquarters in Vienna --
It is difficult to conceal a nuclear program if thorough inspections are performed because nuclear products always have a signature.
Traces are always visible if highly enriched uranium or plutonium were used.
ElBaradei stated that inspectors would perform environmental sampling, gamma radiation surveys from helicopters, internal periodic visits to all capable sites and interviews with all former nuclear scientists to confirm that they are not working in the nuclear program.
ElBaradei stated that the IAEA could not give a 100 percent guarantee but that the presence of inspectors would be a good deterrent and a good mechanism for detection.
ElBaradei stated --
It is necessary to control imports to Iraq because of the risk that Iraq is receiving nuclear material from outside the country.
There must be physical protection of all nuclear material particularly in the former Soviet Union.
There must be strong unanimous support by the UN Security Council to force Iraq to comply with IAEA inspection.
The IAEA must be given as much intelligence information as possible to guide inspectors to anything that should be inspected or to any item hidden from inspectors.
The Security Council has been meeting in open session to discuss the Iraq issue before the vote on conditions under which UN weapons inspectors will return to Baghdad to verify Iraqi assertions that it does not possess nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.
UN weapons inspectors departed Baghdad in 1998.

Bangladesh opposition claims a crime crackdown being carried out by the army is becoming political witchhunt, and human rights groups claim fundamental rights are being violated.
Bangladesh's main opposition leader Sheikh Hasina Wajed said 021102 that an army crackdown on crime was turning into a political witchhunt and targeting her Awami League party.
Troops were ordered into the streets more than 2 weeks ago to eliminate rampant crime but human rights groups claim fundamental rights are being trampled.
Newspapers and rights groups put the toll of those who have died in police and military custody at 16.
Officials say more than 3400 people have been taken into custody since the crackdown began 021017.
The government has confirmed the deaths of 12 people due to heart attacks.
Relatives allege some suspects have been tortured in custody.
The US government and London-based Amnesty International have also expressed concern about the custodial deaths.
Amnesty urged a prompt and fair investigation by an independent body into the deaths.
Sheikh Hasina told reporters at the airport on her return from a private trip to the United States and Europe that initially it appeared to be a neutral anti-crime drive and the opposition Awami League party welcomed it.
Hasina said the crackdown is gradually turning into one to eliminate the Opposition.
Hasina wants the military to arrest real criminals and not violate Bangladesh's constitution and human rights because of concern about such violations in the name of anti-crime drive.
Sheikh Hasina said the military has to operate within the laws of the land as no one is above the law.
Police said the army hadon 021101 arrested former state minister and Awami League lawmaker talukder Abdul khaleque in southwestern Khulna city soon after he spoke at a news conference against the deployment.
The Daily Star newspaper reported that an imam and a local leader of fundamentalist group Jamaat-e-Islami were also arrested on 021101 in Khulna.
Former minister and Awami League lawmaker Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim and Sheikh Hasina's Political Secretary ex-minister Saber Hossain Chowdhury were arrested 021000 along with independent MP Hemayet Ullah aurango.
Selim, Chowdhury and aurango are being detained under the strict 740000 Special Powers Act allowing detention for 120 days without charge.
Sheikh Hasina questioned how 3 of the Awami League party's ex-ministers could be terrorists.
Hasina was apparently unaware of the claims of the arrest of the Jamaat leader when adding that it is an open secret that the Jamaat-e-Islami and the Jamaat-e-Islami student wing have weapons and wondering why none of the Jamaat-e-Islami has been arrested so far.
Hasina said the Awami League party would raise the issue when parliament reconvenes 021114.
Bangladesh's Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's Islamist-allied government includes 2 cabinet ministers from the Jamaat.
Zia's administration denies the drive is politically biased and stresses that activists from ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) have also been detained.
A young BNP activist died 021101 in a hospital after being interrogated by the army.
Police said the activist was wanted in a number of cases.

The Russian government hailed cooperation of Arab countries in fighting terrorism and said not one Arab state backed the Chechen separatists who are accused of waging a terrorist campaign.
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Secretary General Abdel Rahman al-Attiya held talks on 021104.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Yakovenko said afterward that not a single Arab country supports rebels in Chechnya.
Yakovenko said the Russian Government finds it inadmissible to link individual States or religions with terrorism or extremism and is grateful to those Arab states which are trying to cooperate with Russian law enforcement agencies to cut channels for funding terrorist organizations.
The Russian government has consistently sought to portray its campaign against a separatist insurgency in Chechnya as part of the global war on terrorism and says that rebel groups are receiving backing from the terrorist Al-Qaeda network and from shadowy Islamic radical groups based in countries such as Saudi Arabia.
A senior Kremlin official said last week that the Russian Government might ask the GCC State Qatar to extradite Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev.
Yandarbiyev is a former Chechen Vice-President and aide to rebel president Aslan Maskhadov.
The Russian government accuses Yandarbiyev of involvement in the 041000 hostage-taking in a Moscow theater.
Russian government spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said Qatar's response would demonstrate the extent of that country's willingness to cooperate in the fight against international terrorism.
Yakovenko said that stronger ties between Russia and the GCC States could play a special role in combating international terrorism.
Ivanov said al-Attiya's visit will contribute to increased cooperation between the Russian government and the six Arab monarchies of the Gulf region.
Ivanov said the Russian government wanted to strengthen its ties with the Gulf countries and that these ties have begun to strengthen recently.
Ivanovalso said the Russian government would like to develop them further and particularly in areas of mutual interest.
The Russian government has traditionally been close to the Arab side in the Middle East conflict and has spoken strongly against US armed intervention against Iraq in the stand-off over disarmament.
Yakovenko said that Al-Attiya's talks with Russian government officials 021104 and 021105 were likely to focus on oil issues and noted that both the Russian government and the Gulf countries are interested in stable world prices.
Yakovenko said the main emphasis of the talks will be on Russia's possible involvement in the implementation of regional projects run by the Council and said that there will be particular emphasis on finding peaceful, political and diplomatic ways to settle the Iraqi issue.
Al-Attiya also plans to hold talks with economic ministers and senior officials such as the head of the Chamber of Commerce Yevgeny Primakov and the Chairman of the Russian employers' association Arkady Volsky.

Tanzanian Vice President Ali Mohamed Sheni said on November 12, 2002 that Africa needs its own health forum to create research priorities to effectively combat disease on the continent.
Sheni stated that Africa will find it difficult to influence global research priorities in its favor without a forum.
The continent lacks resources.
Sheni attended a four-day meeting to discuss global health at Arusha in northern Tanzania.
Sheni addressed more than 700 public health specialists from 100 countries.
Sheni told delegates at the Global Forum for Health Research's annual meeting that less than 10 percent of the global health research budget of 70 billion dollars went to Africa.
Africa has 90 percent of the global diseases.
Sheni said the formation of the Asian and Pacific Health Research Forum and the Latin American Health Research Forum are steps in the right direction.
Global Forum for Health Research Chairman Richard Feachem said it was unfair for poor countries to be allocated meager sums of research funding.
Feachem said the majority of the poor are getting little health research funding compared to the wealthy few.
The Global Forum for Health Research is an independent, international foundation funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, the World Health Organization, the World Bank and the Governments of Canada, Denmark, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.

New U.S. study claims that one-tenth of Internet's sites are blocked by the Chinese Government authorities using updated Filtering technology.
A wide range of sites including a very high percentage of news sites and keywords were found to be blocked.
A U.S. study released on 03 December 2002 states that one-tenth of the Internet's sites may be blocked by Chinese authorities as part of efforts to prevent access to information on dissidents, Taiwan, Tibet and other subjects.
The study was conducted by Harvard University's berkman Center for Internet and society.
The study found that more than 50000 of the approximately 200000 websites tested were inaccessible from at least 1 point in China on at least 1 occasion.
Using a more narrow definition of blocked site the study concluded that 18931 websites were being blocked to Chinese web users.
Harvard researcher and co-author of the report Ben Edelman stated that it is likely that similar percentages apply to the Internet as a whole.
Edelman told AFP that it is highly likely that approximately one-tenth of the Internet is filtered by or recently has been filtered by China.
Edelman stated that there are many different ways to measure this effect and therefore hesitated to specify any single proportion.
The latest study was broader than prior surveys and gives perspective to disparate reports about websites that are filtered or blocked by China.
In the report it is concluded that --
China blocks a range of web content beyond that which is sexually explicit.
1000s of sites providing information about news, health, education, and entertainment were blocked.
Approximately 3284 sites from Taiwan were blocked.
The blocked sites also included those of U.S. news organizations including ABC News and CBS News, the Alta Vista search engine, and a number of U.S. universities.
The researchers found that 100 percent of the top 10 sites with keywords Tibet, Taiwan China, or equality were blocked.
A large number of other sites with keywords such as freedom, democracy and HIV were also blocked.
The BBC news site was consistently unavailable.
Sites for CNN, Time magazine, U.S.-based public broadcasting system, the Miami Herald, and the Philadelphia Inquirer were also often blocked.
The report found that 42 of google's top 100 results for news were blocked.
Religious sites blocked in China included the Asian American Baptist Church, The atheist network, the Catholic Civil Rights League, Feng Shui, the Jewish Federation of Winnipeg, and the Denver Zen center.
China has an estimated 45 million Internet users.
China has been widely criticized in the West for blocking websites and for imprisoning people for viewing banned sites or using the Internet for anti-government activities.
The Chinese government is believed to routinely block a large number of foreign-based sites primarily those featuring dissident views or banned groups such as the Falungong spiritual organization but also certain foreign news sites and pages showing pornography.
A recent report by the U.S.-based Rand Corporation think tank found that the Chinese government now uses more technology to filter out objectionable content rather than relying solely on surveillance of users and seizure of equipment as it did in the past.
The rand report released earlier in 2002 found that Chinese authorities now appear to have more effective technology for filtering out undesirable content.

A laboratory chief from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on December 10, 2002 that the UN's nuclear agency could detect even infinitesimal amounts of radiation from weapons programs if they exist in samples from Iraq.
A laboratory chief from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on December 10, 2002 that the UN's nuclear agency could detect infinitesimal amounts of radiation from weapons programs if they exist in samples from Iraq.
David Donohue spoke at the IAEA laboratory in Seibersdorf on the southwest outskirts of Vienna.
Donohue said the equipment can detect particles down to the picogram (a millionth of a millionth of a gram).
The first samples from Iraq are due to arrive to the laboratory this week.
IAEA and other UN inspectors have been taking soil, water and air samples since November 27, 2001 at Iraqi sites suspected of being used for programs to make weapons of mass destruction.
Donohue said samples will be sent for corroboration to labs in France, the US, the UK (Britain), Japan and Russia if IAEA finds any traces of radiation from enriched uranium or plutonium, or any chemical and biological agents.
Donohue said it is very difficult to manipulate radioactive isotopes without leaving a trail.
A trail will be left even if it's only ultra-traces.
The IAEA is the UN agency charged with monitoring nuclear activity.
The UN Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) tests for chemical, biological and ballistic missile programs.
UNMOVIC is based in New York.

South Korea urges North Korea to return nuclear reactor to UN surveillance.
North Korea had violated 1994 shut down by disabling surveillance devices.
20021222 South Korea urged North Korea to return the Yongbyon nuclear reactor to UN surveillance in order to deescalate the nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula.
20021221 the UN International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) stated that North Korea had disabled IAEA surveillance devices by breaking seals on IAEA equipment and blocking surveillance cameras at the country's 5 megawatt nuclear reactor.
20021221 IAEA Director General General Mohammed ElBaradei expressed regret over North Korea's actions.
A South Korean Foreign Ministry official stated --
The development is regrettable and will increase tension over North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
Japan and the United States should act jointly with South Korea.
The IAEA stated that ElBaradei warned the government of North Korea not to take further action that would prevent the IAEA from monitoring compliance with the 1994 accord with the United States shutting down the reactor.
20041212 North Korea stated that the country's plutonium-producing nuclear program would recommence in order to produce energy due to a global embargo on oil shipments.
In 1994 the reactor was frozen under an accord in exchange for 500000 tons of fuel oil annually from the United States.
The accord additionally formed a consortium to build 2 light-water reactors.
International experts stated that the Yongbyon reactor was used to produce weapons-grade plutonium.
After the 1994 closing approximately 8000 spent fuel rods from the reactor were sealed in metal casings in cooling ponds.
20041000 the United States revealed that North Korea had admitted to implementing a nuclear program based on enriched uranium, a material for nuclear weapons.

North Korea removed UN seals at a laboratory suspected of being used to produce weapons-grade material.
This activity further escalates tension in the Korean Peninsula's nuclear crisis and ignores international condemnation.
A source close to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said late on 021223 the North had started stripping the UN nuclear regulation group's seals and monitoring equipment from the laboratory at Yongbyon.
The lab is suspected of having reprocessed fuel rods for weapons-grade plutonium before its activities were frozen under a 940000 arms control deal with the United Sates.
The source is fully informed of IAEA activities in North Korea and said the North Koreans are cutting the seals of the nuclear fuel reprocessing laboratory and could complete it possibly by 021224.
The move followed similar actions 021221-021222 at the Yongbyon nuclear facility during which the North Korean government took control of 1000s of spent fuel rods that could be used to make nuclear weapons.
The nuclear crisis dominated the first meeting between South Korean President Kim Dae-Jung and President-elect Roh Moo-hyun earlier 021223.
Kim and Roh were meeting for the first time since Roh's election last week and the meeting was supposed to focus on smoothing over the 030225 transfer of power between the outgoing and incoming leaders.
The 90-minute talks instead centered on the North Korean government's latest standoff with the international community.
President Kim's spokeswoman Park Sun-sook said that Kim and Roh's discussion was pinned down on international relations which focused on North Korea's nuclear issue.
The South Korean government's frustration with the North Korean government was evident in a foreign ministry statement which urged the North Korean government to restore the seals and disabled monitoring cameras on the rods.
The statement said that the North Korean government took further actions to unfreeze its nuclear activities despite repeated warnings from the South Korean government and the international community and was raising regional tension and amplifying international concerns over nuclear proliferation.
The United States responded to that development with swift condemnation.
US State Department spokesman Louis Fintor said the over 8000 spent fuel rods are of particular concern because they can be reprocessed to recover plutonium for nuclear weapons.
US Senator Richard Lugar said the North Korean government was creating a very dangerous situation, initially for South Korea and for Japan but ultimately for the United States.
Lugar will head the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee in 030000.
The United States has been stepping up international pressure on the North Korean government since 021222.
Deputy US Ambassador Evans Revere met South Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Lee Tai-sik in Seoul on 021223 to discuss countermeasures to be taken against the North Korean government following the US and South Korean foreign ministers' urgent talks over the phone.
Japanese Foreign Minister Yoriko Kawaguchi also expressed the widespread international alarm about the North Korean government's regrettable latest move.
Analysts have said North Koreans could extract some 25 kilograms (55 pounds) of weapons-grade plutonium for at least 3 nuclear weapons from the irradiated rods.
The North Korean government said it unfroze its nuclear facilities because it was in a desperate energy crisis aggravated by the suspension of fuel oil shipments.
The US government said the spent plutonium has nothing to do with power generation.
The United States and North Korea came close to war over the North Korean government's plutonium program in the early 1990s.
The confrontation was defused when the US and North Korean Governments signed the 940000 agreed framework.
That accord has been undermined since the North Korean government admitted in 021000 to running a new, secret and separate program based on enriched uranium.
The US government cut its fuel aid to the North Korea in retaliation.

North Korea was criticized on December 26, 2002 for moving to restart its long-dormant nuclear program.
The UN atomic agency said such moves were tantamount to nuclear brinkmanship.
North Korea was criticized on December 26, 2002 for moving to restart its long-dormant nuclear program.
The UN atomic agency said such moves were tantamount to nuclear brinkmanship.
South Korean President Kim Dae Jung told officials that North Korea's shifting of unspent fuel rods into a building housing a reactor capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium aggravated an already-tense situation.
Kim Dae Jung and officials assembled at an urgent national security meeting.
Kim Dae Jung said that North Korea moved to restart frozen nuclear facilities despite the international community's efforts for a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue.
This further aggravated the situation.
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said the shift of the rods was proactive.
Plutonium could be extracted for making nuclear warheads within months.
The United States dismissed the action as nuclear blackmail.
There was strong criticism from the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Beginning last week IAEA saw its monitoring equipment disabled and seals removed from the nuclear facilities that had been dormant since a 1994 accord with the United States.
IAEA director Mohamed ElBaradei dismissed claims by North Korea's government that it was only acting in the wake of an energy crisis in North Korea.
ElBaradei said that the reprocessing facility at Yongbyong is irrelevant to North Korea's ability to produce electricity.
North Korea has no current legitimate peaceful use for plutonium given the status of its nuclear fuel cycle.
ElBaradei said restarting North Korea's nuclear facilities without appropriate safeguards and towards producing plutonium raises serious non-proliferation concerns is tantamount to nuclear brinkmanship.
The move of 1,000 unspent rods into the reactor building is the latest action taken by the energy-starved North since the apparent collapse of a 1994 accord that froze its nuclear capacity.
The move is confirmed by both the UN agency and the South Korean Foreign Ministry.
The facility has the capacity for 8,000 rods.
All have been stored in a cooling pond at Yongbyon since the United States offered North Korea annual supplies of heavy fuel oil and two new light water nuclear reactors in return for Pyongyang's agreement to freeze its nuclear operations at Yongbyon.
The eight-year-old deal has fallen apart following US revelations in October 2002 that North Korea had admitted to running a separate nuclear program based on enriched uranium technology in violation of the accord.
North Korea is bankrupt and on the brink of economic collapse.
It has been pushing for negotiations with the United States.
Experts say North Korea needs aid and security guarantees from the United States to ensure its survival.
Throughout the nuclear dispute North Korea has said it is ready to sit down and talk with the United States and even to refreeze its Yongbyon program.
President Kim has been pushing the United States to accept the offer under Kim's sunshine policy of engagement with the North.
President Kim has criticized the United States for previously sidelining South Korea in handling North Korea and said South Korea should take a leading role.
Kim was critical of the US handling of the stand-off when eight years ago the United States and North Korea drew back from the brink of war over Pyongyang's plutonium program.
The President has complained that South Korea was sidelined during the entire dispute and ended up paying a multi-billion dollar bill for the light-water reactors.
Kim's chief security adviser Yim Sung-joon said the President instructed that North Korea should take lead because the North Korean nuclear issue is important to the Korean peninsula.
This was said in a statement after December 26, 2002's meeting.
The United States said it would stand up to nuclear blackmail and has ruled out negotiations.
The US pledged not to reward bad behavior.
Experts have joined the IAEA in dismissing the idea that North Korea was relaunching the reactor for energy purposes.
Director General for International institutions at the ministry in Seoul Chun Young-Woo said it would produce at its peak enough for one large office building which is a negligible amount.

Experts warn that North Korea could produce weapons-grade plutonium from spent fuel rods at re-opened nuclear reactor.
Existing rods could produce 3-6 atomic bombs in 6-8 months.
Experts stated that 8000 spent fuel rods reportedly stockpiled by North Korea at a nuclear reactor the country is threatening to re-start could be used to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons.
Experts stated that the rods could produce 3-6 atomic bombs in 6-8 months.
The IAEA stated that North Korea additionally moved 1000 fresh rods into the nuclear reactor as well.
The reactor could produce enough spent rods to construct 1 atomic bomb per year if reactivated.
The experimental nuclear plant in Yongbyon is a miniature of electricity-producing nuclear plants in Western countries but operates on the same principles.
The Yongbyon plant produces 5 megawatts.
Plants in France produce 1300 megawatts.
The Yongbyon plant is 100 km north of the North Korean capital Pyongyang.
Nuclear reactor process --
4 meter fuel rods containing uranium oxide are burned to initiate fission -- the nucleus of the uranium atom is split, releasing neutrons that collide with other atoms, creating more neutrons in a chain reaction.
Fission produces immense heat which is applied to water to create steam which drives turbines to generate electricity.
Plutonium and other radioactive byproducts of the process accumulate and decrease the effectiveness of the rods until they are spent after 3-4 years.
Spent rods consisting of highly radioactive plutonium and residual uranium are cooled in pools of water for several years to diminish radioactivity and then the plutonium is then recovered in nitrate form and converted into oxide.
The recovered plutonium can be mixed with uranium for reuse in the reactor or used in making nuclear weapons.
Nuclear experts stated that to make weapons, a high proportion of plutonium 239 (military grade plutonium, as opposed to the commercial plutonium used in power plants) must be extracted.

British officials are deeply concerned by a warning from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) concerning North Korea's opening of the Yongbyon facility and possible nuclear intentions.
A UK Foreign Office spokeswoman said Thursday that the UK government is deeply concerned about the latest revelations in a warning by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) concerning North Korea's possible nuclear intentions.
The comments came after the IAEA accused the North Korean government of nuclear brinkmanship and said the North Korean government had begun work to reactivate the Yongbyon reactor in breach of a 940000 agreement with the United States Government.
The UK Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said the UK government is in regular contact with international partners about the implications of the latest developments and is committed to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction wherever it may occur.
The spokeswoman added that the North Korean government must comply with international obligations and eliminate nuclear weapons.
The IAEA has said the North Korean government had no current legitimate peaceful use for plutonium that could be produced at the newly reopened Yongbyon site that is capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium.
The IAEA said the North Koreans had moved 1000 fresh fuel rods into the Yongbyon reactor building.
Of more concern are the 8000 spent fuel rods at the facility they started unsealing 021215-021221 and the dismantling of IAEA monitoring equipment at the site.
Experts say the spent rods could be used to build 3-6 atomic bombs within 6-8 months.
The United States Government offered supplies of fuel oil and 2 new light water nuclear reactors in return for the North Korean government's agreement to freeze nuclear operations under the 940000 agreed framework shutting down Yongbyon.
The agreement fell apart following US government revelations in 021000 that the North Korean government had admitted to a separate nuclear program based on enriched uranium technology.
The US government suspended oil shipments to North Korea as punishment.
The North Korean government in turn claimed to be in desperate need of power generation after the oil supplies were cut and began during 021215-021221 to unseal the spent fuel rods at the facility and to dismantle monitoring equipment.

South Korea threatens to cease support following North Korean nuclear re-activation.
President-elect Roh seeks peaceful solution.
20021227 South Korean President-elect Roh Moo-hun stated --
South Korea will cease support if North Korea continues to ignore global concern over the country's nuclear weapons program.
North Korea should not act further to aggravate the situation.
Inter-Korean exchanges will suffer if tensions among South Koreans escalate due to the actions of North Korea.
South Korea must take initiative in coping with the crisis because the issue directly concerns the Korean people's survival.
Roh campaigned on a pro-engagement platform and has endorsed President Kim Dae-jung's softline sunshine policy of engagement with North Korea.
An aide stated that Roh's incoming Administration has established channels of communication with the North to defuse the crisis and discover North Korea's intentions.
The US supports the initiative.
Roh takes office in 20030200.
North Korea is re-activating nuclear operations at Yongbyon after violating a 1994 arms control deal with the United States.
The IAEA stated that North Korea has cut seals and impeded surveillance equipment at 3 facilities at Yongbyon.
Yongbyon is 100 km north of Pyongyang.
The United States urged North Korea to meet obligations under international arms control accords.
US State Department spokeswoman Brenda Greenberg stated that attempts to restarts facilities would compound North Korea's violations of these international commitments.
20030110 President George W. Bush is to send an envoy to Seoul do discuss defusing the crisis with Roh.
Roh will subsequently send an envoy to Washington.
Roh has advocated a peaceful resolution to the crisis through dialogue and has criticized the US hardline policy as potentially dangerous.
20021226 incoming Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Republican Senator Richard Lugar stated on NBC television that a US attack would be inadvisable because North Korea would likely retaliate with a potentially devastating attack on the Seoul area.
Roh's aide acknowledged Lugar's statement.
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer stated that Australia will suspend plans to open an embassy in Pyongyang to avoid appearing to condone North Korea's nuclear actions.
20021226 IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei stated --
North Korea has moved 1,000 fresh fuel rods into the reactor building at Yongbyon -- which is capable of producing military plutonium -- as a prelude to reactivation.
North Korea has no use for plutonium in its civilian program and thus may be planning military activity.
The IAEA's board of governors will shortly issue a report on the recent developments.
The Board was originally scheduled to meet 20030106.

China launches unmanned space craft Shenzhou IV into a preset orbit with the eventual goal of sending astronauts into space.
30 December 2002 at 00:40 am -- China launched space craft Shenzhou IV into a preset orbit.
Shenzhou IV was launched by a Long March II F carrier rocket from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern Gansu province.
Chinese scientists announced Shenzhou IV would conduct experiments on the astronaut flight system and control of Shenzhou IV's environment and life support system.
A Chinese aerospace official announced Shenzhou IV would return to Inner Mongolia within 7 days.
According to the Xinhua news agency the leading designer of the astronaut system for China's manned space program commander Su Shuangning stated --
China will soon send astronauts to space.
Shenzhou IV is equipped to carry astronauts.
Chinese astronauts must first receive training in basic theories, professional skills and flight procedures and tasks.
In July 2002 the Pentagon announced --
China could send astronauts into space in 2003.
China plans to build a reusable space vehicle similar to the US space shuttle.
14 Chinese astronauts have undergone training on Shenzhou space craft.
The Chinese astronauts were selected from thousands of air force pilots.
In 2001 Russia signed a 5-year space cooperation agreement with China.
The agreement stipulates that Russia provide China with manned space craft technologies and train Chinese astronauts in Russian facilities.
In May 2002 official Chinese media announced that China plans to establish a base on the moon to exploit the Moon's mineral resources.
Space expert at the French Institute for International Relations in Paris Laurence nardon stated --
US should not view China's space manned program as a security threat.
China is a member of the ballistic missile club.
China's space program is less of a world threat than India's or Israel's.
Some US researchers believe China is developing weaponization of its space technology.
China may be developing weaponization of its space technology but is not currently able to implement it.
China plans to put humans in space for prestige.
In November 2002 Chinese Aerospace Science and Technology Corp. President Zhang Qingwei stated --
Shenzhou III's carrier rocket was equipped with a fault-detecting and handling system.
Shenzhou IV is backed by a ground-based search and rescue system and reinforced by other more reliable safety measures than Shenzhou III's.
Designer of China's spacecraft system Qi Faren announced --
The functions, indices and data relevant to manned flights tested well on three previous successful launches and landings of Shenzhou spaceships between 1999 and March 2002.
China established a space program in 1992.
Shenzhou I launched in November 1999 and returned to earth within one day.
10 January 2001 -- Shenzhou II launched.
Western analysts suspect re-entry failed.
25 March 2002 -- Shenzhou III launched.
The re-entry vehicle successfully returned to Inner Mongolia a week later.
Only the US and former USSR have sent humans into space.
Shenzhou IV is also referred to as Divine Vessel IV.

European Space Agency is finalizing deal with Russian government to allow for Soyuz rockets to be launched from Europe's space command at Kourou, in French Guiana replacing phased-out Ariane-4 launchers.
Plans for Soyuz launches have been delayed by funding issues since costly modifications to launch facilities must be made to accommodate the Russian rocket.
The European Space Agency (ESA) stated 10 January 2003 that it was finalizing a deal with the Russian government that could allow Soyuz rockets to be launched from Europe's space command at Kourou, French Guiana.
The deal between the ESA and the Russian Government could be written as early as March 2003 and signed by the Russian government in April 2003.
The deal would allow for Soyuz missiles to help replace phased-out Ariane-4 launchers.
Ariane-4 launchers send payloads up to 2.8 tons into geostationary orbit.
Spacecraft launched from Kourou benefit from the Earth's full rotational speed on the equator to aid their trajectory into space.
With this extra momentum, the spacecraft require less fuel.
Plans for the Soyuz launches have been delayed by funding issues since modifications to be made to launch facilities in order to accommodate the Russian rocket are predicted to cost between 250 and 300 million euro.
The Russian space program has experienced funding problems and was unwilling to contribute one third of the bill as ESA had requested.
In November 2002 the Government of France proposed to fund the Russian Government's share with a loan to be paid back by profits from the launches.
The ESA stated that no financial divisions have been decided yet.
France joined Russia in creating a joint company Starsem in 1996 to commercialize and market the Soyuz launches from Russia's Baikonur Space Center in Kazakhstan.
Soyuz missiles used to send satellites and cosmonauts into space are the most used type of spacecraft.
Soyuz missiles have over 1700 launches since first launching the Sputnik satellite into orbit in 1957.

Prime Minister Koizumi meets with President Putin to demand that North Korea reverse NPT withdrawal.
Koizumi pledges continued support for Russian disarmament.
20030111 Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi stated to a gathering of scientists at Kurchatov Research Institute in Moscow --
Japan demands that North Korea annul the 20030110 decision to withdraw from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
Japan will collaborate with the International Atomic Energy Agency and countries including Russia to ensure North Korea's reversal.
Koizumi condemns and is concerned by North Korea's decision.
20030110 Koizumi held a day-long summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Koizumi stated that Koizumi and Putin held identical views on the North Korean crisis.
Late 20030110 a Japanese spokesman stated to Interfax news that Koizumi encouraged Putin to employ the Russian government's influence on North Korean leadership in pursuing a reversal.
Putin consented to Koizumi's request and stated that dialogue with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il was possible.
Koizumi stated that Russia, Japan, and the international community would benefit from improved bilateral relations if Russia and Japan could overcome previous disputes.
In 1945 the Soviet Union seized 4 Southern Kuril Islands still claimed by Japan.
Koizumi stated --
Japan will continue to assist Russia in dismantling weapons of mass destruction including decommissioned nuclear submarines for which Japan will allocate over 200 million dollars.
The weapons should be neutralized immediately in the interest of global security.
Japan will contribute 100 million dollars to the processing of weapons-grade plutonium to prevent appropriation by terrorists.
Japan has contributed 56 million dollars to scientific projects and will continue to cooperate with Russia.
Russia has previously refused to pressure North Korea over defense policy.
Analysts believe that Russia has limited authority to do so.
Koizumi visited the grave of Japanese World War II prisoners in a cemetery at the donskoi monastery in Moscow.
Koizumi will visit the Far Eastern city of Khabarovsk late 20030111 and return to Tokyo 20030112.

An Indian information technology expert disproved the phobia of cyber attacks and said the threat was overstated.
Director of the Indian Institute of Information Technology S. Sadagopan said the cyber attack is similar to the Y2K myth; although these things could happen, they will not happen.
Y2K was a computer malfunction expected to occur when 1999 changed to 2000 but it did not inflict widespread damage.
Sadagopan addressed delegates at a conference on information security.
Sadagopan stated that these things happen with all technology if history is reviewed and that imaginative people can cause extraordinary problems even with primitive technology.
Sadagopan said the G8 nations have lost 43 billion dollars due to cyber crime.
The G8 nations are comprised of France, Britain, Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States.
Sadagopan said most people have an alarmist view of such attacks.
The attacks range from viruses, flame-mail (abusive e-mail), stone throwing (disfiguring a home page) to cyber squatters and scripts for breaking into Internet sites.
Sadagopan stated that many sensitive installations such as nuclear and power plants, and missiles have an Internet protocol address and that once someone hacks into the sites one can trip the power lines or lead planes and missiles to their choice destinations.
Sadagopan added that this type of hacking is possible, but there is no need to panic.
Sadagopan said it needs to be recognized and while we should be sensitive about such threats it should not be sensationalized rather a pragmatic approach should be taken.
The U.S. State Department said in May 2002 that a computer Hacker had infiltrated its e-mail system.
The Hacker sent a potentially damaging virus to more than 20000 people who receive travel warnings electronically.
A 50-line code of the love bug virus affects more than 2.8 million files monthly.
Hackers have sent love letter e-mail to all chosen Heads of States from adolfahitler.com.
Pentagon sites had denial of service for more than three hours.
India's premier nuclear research center Bhabha Atomic resarch center sites were disfigured.
Sadagopan stated that a section of technologists think cyber soldiers, cyber policemen and cyber insurance is needed.
Sadagopan said the threat is overstated and that it is like any other threat, like a foreigner driving on Bangalore roads.
The threat needs to be accepted and then education is the next step.
Sadagopan said it needs to be started today.
It cannot be postponed.

Pakistan authorities announce upgrades of security of nuclear facilities and employees after press reports alleging leaks of its its nuclear technology.
Pakistan on 030122 announced upgrades to the security of nuclear facilities and employees after a series of press reports alleging leaks of nuclear technology to North Korea and possibly Iran and Iraq.
The Los Angeles Times, New York Times and Japanese media have carried several reports quoting unnamed US officials saying that Pakistani scientists or military officers had sold the North Korean government uranium-enrichment technology for the nuclear program.
Pakistan's government has angrily rejected the reports as malicious and insisted that nuclear technology had never been sold or leaked.
The military statement said Pakistan's has a long-standing capability for achieving the highest levels of safety and security which is adequate and fail-safe.
The Pakistani government's announcement came after President Pervez Musharraf chaired a meeting of the Development Control Committee of the National Command Authority (NCA) to review security of Pakistan's nuclear program.
An official military statement said the physical protection and custodial controls at Pakistan's nuclear sites and facilities has been recently upgraded.
The statement said the NCA gave approval for further tightening of different defensive layers and enhancing physical security as well as ensuring the effectiveness of watertight safety of materials, equipment and technology.
The NCA also adopted steps to improve personal reliability programs for people working in nuclear-related programs.
Scientists, engineers and military officers working in nuclear programs are routinely screened every 2 years according to a survey of Pakistan's nuclear security by Italy's arms control institution the Landau network.
2 Pakistani nuclear scientists were arrested 12 months ago and interrogated by US Federal Bureau of Investigation agents on suspicion of possible cooperation with the Taliban.
These arrests underlined fears that nuclear technology could fall into the hands of Islamic extremists.
Pakistan's government has been developing a nuclear program to match arch-rival India's since the 1970s and only went public with the program in 980500 when testing 5 nuclear devices.
Jane's Defence Weekly estimates that Pakistan's government possesses 25-50 nuclear warheads and has a uranium enrichment plant and plutonium reprocessing plant close to the capital Islamabad and at least 4 nuclear reactors across the country.
Pakistan's NCA also decided on 030122 not to respond to India's 3 missile tests this month and stated that Pakistan's government has no desire to increase tension in the region.

Islamic activists condemn the arrests of Kashmiri separatist leaders in the Indian zone of the disputed Himalayan region.
On 25 January 2003 many Islamic activists rallied against the arrests of Kashmiri separatist leaders in the Indian zone of the disputed Himalayan region.
The fundamentalist Jamaat-i-Islami party of Pakistani-administered Kashmir organized the rally.
The rally was held on the call of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC).
The APHC is an umbrella group of anti-India outfits.
Witnesses to the protest stated --
Protestors carried banners and placards.
Protestors chanted that India should release Syed Ali Geelani and other Kashmiri leaders and that Indian aggressors should leave Kashmir.
9 June 2002 Indian police arrested Syed Ali Geelani.
Geelani was charged with aiding and abetting terrorist activities and funding terrorist organizations in the Kashmir state.
Geelani is an executive member of Hurriyat.
Geelani is held in the Ranchi jail in India's eastern state of Jharkhand.
APHC organized protest after reports that Geelani's health was deteriorating.
Geelani is elderly.
Kashmir is divided between India and Pakistan.
Kashmir is claimed by both India and Pakistan.
The dispute over Kashmir caused 2 of the 3 wars between India and Pakistan since India and Pakistan's independence from Britain in 1947.
An Indian insurgency has resulted in the deaths of more than 37500 people in 13 years.
Local Jamaat-i-Islami leader Sheikh Aqeel told protestors --
India has been detaining Kashmiris to suppress Pakistan's freedom movement.
the freedom movement will never be suppressed.
Pakistan's armed forces should advance in Kashmir to liberate its territory under Indian occupation.
Jamaat-i-Islami's youth wing staged a separate demonstration in Kashmir.
Jamaat-i-Islami's youth wing's demonstration was against a US attack on Iraq.

Vice President of macafee avert labs and leader of network associates' antivirus response team Vincent gulloto stated that by late 20030125 the worm affected nearly 250000 computers worldwide.
The attack targeted the popular Microsoft database software SQL server 2000.
Traffic control sites worldwide registered decelerated email and other transmissions at at 0530 GMT on 20030125 but the private Internet-monitoring and network protection advising group cert and the national infrastructure Protection Center stated that activity normalized by 1500 GMT.
In South Korea the worm caused the country's worst telecommunications breakdown through the crashing of high-speed networks.
Online shopping and banking transactions were paralyzed.
Shortly before 12 am 20030125 online service resumed in South Korea.
Traffic remained slow for South Korean Internet users 20030126.
The worm struck the US at 0530 GMT 20030125.
Most of Bank of America's 13000 ATMs were inoperable.
Some trans-Atlantic Internet and phone service was disrupted.
US companies were able to repair systems without disrupting business because the attack occurred on a weekend.
Other countries --
Computer experts in China and Taiwan stated that clients have reported major networking problems.
Damage in Japan was limited to some schools and companies but experts warned of a possible expansion with the start of the work week on 20030127.
20030126 South Korean information and communication minister Lee Sang-Chul held emergency talks with State and private network experts and apologized for the Internet breakdown.
Lee stated --
A second attack by the slammer worm or more malignant variants could more severely disrupt networks on 20030127.
Both the public and firms are required to follow the Ministry's guidelines.
Computer experts warned that slammer could be a pilot for a larger future attack.
Director of Research Alan paller of the high-tech security organization the Sans Institute in Bethesda, Maryland stated that in the near or distant future a similar attack will occur.
Security experts stated that hackers could have implemented the slammer attack on the weekend in order to gauge damage in advance of launching a more devastating attack.
Similar attacks --
In 20010700 the Code Red virus affected 300000 computers.
The slammer worm was the largest Internet attack since the Nimda virus on 20010918.
Slammer is a computer worm.
Unlike viruses, worms do not require a user to initiate a command such as opening an email attachment to infect the computer.
Worms carry a self-regenerating mechanism that enables them to multiply rapidly across the web and triggers the flow of copious transmissions into computer systems.

Plutonium enough to produce 25 nuclear bombs which has gone unaccounted for at a Japanese nuclear facility is mostly due to measuring shortcomings and miscalculations.
A nuclear fuel reprocessing plant about 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Tokyo in Tokaimura has extracted 6890 kilograms (15158 pounds or 7.6 short tons) of plutonium from spent nuclear fuel since it began operating in 770000.
A Japanese education and science ministry official said on 030128 that the total currently accounted for at the facility was 206 kg short of the plutonium initially estimated to have been produced by reprocessing spent nuclear fuel from power plants.
It is known to take 5-8 kg of plutonium to produce a nuclear bomb.
The official at the ministry's nuclear safeguard office said that the case had been reported to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of the United Nations.
The finding was also reported to the Japanese government's Atomic Energy Commission on 030128.
The education and scienc Ministry denied the possibility that any plutonium had been illegally removed from the facility.
The official said 94 kg of the missing plutonium is presumed to have dissolved into waste water without being measured.
The official added that another 29 kg disintegrated into another type of element.
The official said that plutonium may have been stuck to fuel tubes or mixed with waste water being processed to be solidified in glass and disposed of.
The official also pointed to possible errors in the estimate of plutonium extracted in the process.
The official said that there was a need for improvements in measuring and evaluating methods of plutonium.
The report was based on inspections at the Tokaimura facility done under IAEA safeguard rules designed to prevent the transfer of nuclear materials for production of nuclear weapons.
Tokaimura is a Pacific Coast complex of nuclear-related facilities and made headlines in 990000 when the world's worst nuclear plant accident since Chernobyl in 860000 occurred at a uranium reprocessing plant there.
3 workers set off a critical reaction in 990000 when they poured too much uranium into a precipitation tank.
2 of the 3 workers later died.
Safety concerns at nuclear facilities in Japan were further highlighted on 030127 when a High Court upheld the suspension of operations of a troubled experimental fast-breeder reactor which has been shut since an accident in 950000.

Officials stated that on 030128 Italy's Internet network was hit by most serious Internet attack to date that severely disrupted Italy's post offices.
The attack on Italy's Internet network occurred as similiar attacks around the globe appeared to be subsiding.
A computer security expert named Fulvio berghella stated that the 030128 attack on Italy's Internet network were the result of a digital worm named sq hell and that the attack was the worst Internet attack ever to hit Italy.
Fulvio berghella stated that the digital worm named sq hell was particularly virulent and replicated itself at the rate of 8000 times an hour.
Fulvio berghella heads an Internet security firm named securitynet.
Fulvio berghella stated that the digital worm named sq hell has a very high capacity to replicate itself and the digital worm named sq Hell is slowing down the Poste italiane computer network and making some computers inoperable.
The sq Hell is considered a computer worm.
A computer worm is unlike a computer virus and does not require a user to open an e-mail attachment or initiate any other type of command to infect the computer.
Paolo baldelli stated that online work at Italy's 14000 post offices was severely disrupted by the Internet attack.
Paolo baldelli stated that the Internet attack overloaded computers with millions of messages.
Paolo baldelli is the official responsible for Poste italiane's computer system.

Indian Deputy PM identifies Southeast Asia as a new center for jihadi terrorism and urges closer international counter-terrorism cooperation following bombing in Bali.
20030204 Indian Deputy Prime Minister Lal Krishna Advani stated at a public lecture in Singapore addressing academics, diplomats and business executives that Southeast Asia was becoming an operational center of terrorism and Governments must cooperate more closely to combat terrorism.
20021012 terrorists executing a bombing attack on the Indonesian resort island of Bali.
Indonesian authorities stated that the Islamic militant group Jemaah Islamiyah is responsible.
The attack is considered part of a global incitement to Jihad by al-Qaeda and its allies.
Advani stated --
The Bali attack established Southeast Asia as a potential new theater for the spread of jihadi extremism.
India previously knew that the operational center of jihadi terrorism is located near India due to the US-lead bombing campaign against extremist bases in Afghanistan.
Advani stated --
The menace of religious extremism has inspired international terrorism.
Terrorism should not be identified with any religion but jihadi terrorism has spread more global violence than any other extremist doctrine.
Advani stated --
Countries must continue in pursuing enhanced cooperation including intelligence sharing and border controls to combat the problem perpetrated by global terrorism and its concomitants -- drug trafficking, illegal arms trade and cross-border crime.
While the international consensus is that terrorism cannot be tolerated, the instruments the international community proposes to deal with terrorism do not meet the requirements of the problem.
Advani stated at a forum organized by the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies --
Countries must formulate and implement an integrated and cooperative approach to security by designing new security systems to protecting transport, communication and energy infrastructure from terrorist attack as well as obstructing terrorists' funding.
Unilateral military action such as the standoff between the US and Iraq on disarming Iraqi President Saddam Hussein threatens peace and could lead to unforeseen negative consequences.
The issue of weapons of mass destruction should be dealt with in the UN.
Rising tensions in the Middle East will affect oil prices.
The the region should provide greater energy security through developing alternative energy technologies.
Advani visited Singapore 20030202-20030205.

Myanmar's military arrested 12 activists from pro-democracy parties for anti-government activities undertaken with funding from dissident expatriates.
On 30210 Myanmar's military stated that the military had arrested 12 activists from pro-democracy parties for anti-government activities undertaken with funding from dissident expatriates.
At a specially called media briefing a Myanmar military spokesman stated that he 12 arrested activists were mostly members of the opposition party named National League for Democracy.
National League for Democracy is headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.
Aung San Suu Kyi was released 020500 from 19 months of house arrest.
Human rights activists claim Myanmar still has 1200 to 1300 political prisoners despite a series of political prisoners releases in 020000.
At the specially called media briefing a military intelligence official Brigadier General Than Tun that it has been discovered that some members of the legally standing political parties inside Myanmar have been engaged in anti-government activities with financial support from dissident expatriates.
Than Tun stated that some of the 12 arrested activists had produced anti-government materials.
The people alleged to have produced anti-government materials included a National League for Democracy Vice Chairman from Kamayut township named Khin Win and Shan National League for Democracy's Secretary Sai Nyunt Lwin.
The pamphlets containing anti-government materials had been found with another National League for Democracy member named Maung Maung Myint.
Maung Maung Myint had returned to Myanmar from exile in Thailand.
Maung Maung Myint's arrest in Myanmar had led to the arrests of the other 11 activists.
Than Tun stated Maung Maung Myint was arrested on 030210 together with around 450 anti-government pamphlets that Maung Maung Myint admitted he had personally authored.
Than Tun stated Maung Maung Myint had also admitted to authoring an anti-government pamphlet targeting monks and students and that 1000 copies of these pantalets had been produced for public distribution.
Than Tun stated the pro-democracy activist were obviously trying to get the sympathy of monks as well as the general public for the pro-democracy cause.
Than Tun stated that Myanmar's military will take legal action against some of the 12 arrested activists and release those Myanmar's military deem to be innocent after the investigation is complete.
Than Tun stated that everything involving the prosecution of the 12 arrested activist will be legal and transparent.
Than Tun stated that international human rights group such as Amnesty International do not need to be concerned about illegal prosecution of the 12 arrested activist.
Amnesty International returned last week from Amnesty International's first fact-finding mission to Myanmar.
Myanmar is widely criticised for Myanmar's poor human rights record.
In a 030210 briefing in Bangkok regarding Amnesty International's first visit to Myanmar, Amnesty International called for the release of all political prisoners and pressured Myanmar's government to improve Myanmar's human rights record.
Amnesty International stated that Myanmar's authorities had in no way hindered Amnesty International's fact-finding mission.
Than Tun stated that despite the fact that it was clear some members of the opposition parties were involved in anti-Government activities Myanmar's military have not accused the leadership of the National League for Democracy or the Shan National League for Democracy of being directly involved.
Than Tun stated that it remains to be seen whether the opposition parties involved will take disciplinary action or act in the defense of the 12 arrested activist.
The National League for Democracy won general elections in 900000 and won 392 of 485 contested seats.
The ruling junta has refused to recognise the victory of the National League for Democracy.

A team of South African weapons experts departs for Iraq with UN approval to assist with Iraq's disarmament program.
Political tensions are increasing as the U.S. threatens war against Iraq.
South African President Thabo Mbeki stated on 18 February 2003 that a South African team of weapons experts will depart to Iraq within days to assist with Iraq's disarmament program.
In an address to parliament in Cape Town Mbeki stated --
A number of distinguished South Africans will travel to Iraq this week.
The weapons experts will be able to address all matters that relate to nuclear, chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction, missile systems, non-proliferation and disarmament.
Mbeki stated in his State of the Nation Address on 14 February 2003 that Iraq had accepted an offer from South Africa to send a team of weapons experts to assist Iraqi government officials, scientists and engineers with its disarmament program.
South Africa dismantled a number of nuclear weapons 10 years ago and was recently praised for its model cooperation with weapons experts invited to inspect its sites.
Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Aziz Pahad stated that South Africa is the only country in the world that has destroyed nuclear weapons.
Pahad stated that the group of South African experts will be able to assist the Iraqis by relating its experience.
The team of seven experts comprises Deon Smit, Ben Steyn, Phillip Coleman, super moloi, Daan van beeck, Peter Goosen and Tom Markram.
The team would visit Iraq in a consulting role and would not replace UN weapons inspectors.
Ben Steyn is a colonel in the South African National Defense Force.
Steyn oversaw the end of the apartheid regime's chemical and biological warfare program called Project Coast.
Germ warfare expert Wouter Basson directed Project Coast before Steyn.
In 2002 Basson was acquitted in a South African court on all 46 charges filed against him including murder, fraud and drug dealing.
Basson's trial related to his work as head of Project Coast.
Basson's trial lasted 30 months.
Smit is a South African parastatal Armscor's acquisitions general manager.
Coleman is the Managing Director of South Africa's designated single small-scale facility in terms of the Chemical Weapons Convention.
Van beek is the director of non-proliferation and space in the Trade and Industry Department.
Van beek also heads the secretariat for the Council for the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction which oversees South Africa's non-proliferation legislation.
Mbeki expressed confidence that the South African team of experts would contribute greatly to Iraq's efforts to meet obligations imposed by the UN Security Council.
The Government of South Africa's proposal to assist the Iraqi government was discussed with UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the UN weapons inspectors in Iraq.
This week the UN Security Council is debating U.S. threats to lead a war on Iraq after chief UN weapons inspector Hans Blix delivered a progress report to the body on 14 February 2003.
South Africa's ambassador to the United Nations Dumisani Khumalo has been calling for public sessions of the Security Council instead of closed meetings in order to allow other countries to participate in discussions.
South Africa is the chair of both the African Union and Non-Aligned Movement and has been vocal in its opposition to an attack on Iraq.
South Africa states that the UN Security Council is the only body fit to deal with the matter.
In February 2003 Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former President Nelson Mandela stated that U.S. President George W. Bush lacked foresight, could not think properly, and would cause a world holocaust if the U.S. continued with plans to wage war against Iraq.
Critics have stated that despite the dire effects an Iraqi conflict would have on the African continent South Africa needed to carefully assess balancing its economic relations with the United States with its serious opposition to a U.S.-led war.
In his speech before parliament 14 February 2003 Mbeki referred to this criticism as most unfortunate stating --
Critics suggest that the South African Government's behavior with regard to the United States Government should be governed by economic benefits that derive from AGOA (African Growth and Opportunity Act).
The South African government maintains very good relations with the United States Government.
Differences on any issue have never pressured the South African Government into submitting to the United States' views.

Iranian opposition group accused Iran of building banned uranium enrichment sites as part of a nuclear weapons program with goal of altering power balance in region.
UN nuclear inspectors to depart for Iran to conduct inspections of 2 sites.
On 20 February 2003 Iranian opposition group National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) stated that Iran was building banned uranium enrichment sites as part of a nuclear weapons program.
The statement was made on the evening preceding a UN team's departure for Iran to conduct inspections at 2 nuclear sites.
U.S. Representative for NCRI soona samsami stated at a press conference in Washington D.C. that Iran's strategy is to build weapons of mass destruction and nuclear weapons in particular in order to alter the balance of power in the region in its favor and to facilitate export of fundamentalism and terrorism.
UN International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors and its director Mohamed ElBaradei depart for Iran 21 February 2003 to conduct an inspection at a site in Natanz where representatives of the NCRI have stated that the regime has concealed a test centrifuge.
NCRI showed satellite photographs of a site in Natanz portraying a cluster of warehouses in which the group claims the regime has hidden centrifuges used to enrich uranium that could be used in nuclear weapons.
Samsami stated that the clerical regime is taking advantage of the current crisis in the region and has accelerated its efforts to obtain nuclear weapons.
On 09 February 2003 Iranian President Mohammed Khatami recognized the existence of a uranium mine and extraction center but promised that the uranium would be used only for peaceful purposes.
The U.S. government was skeptical of Iran's intentions and stated that Iran's pursuit of a complete fuel cycle only made sense if it were pursuing nuclear weapons.
NCRI stated on 20 February 2003 that Iran's clerical rulers are also building and have tested missiles that would eventually have a range of 4000 to 6000 kilometers (2500 to 3700 miles).
NCRI stated that the information on Iran's weapons program had been supplied through their intelligence network within Iran and that satellite photographs were supplied by the Institute for Science and International Security.
The Institute for Science and International Security is a non-profit clearinghouse for security information and images.
Samsami stated --
The Iranian government had removed sensitive equipment from the Natanz site in anticipation of the IAEA inspection this weekend.
The Iranian government intended to bar IAEA entry to 1 of the 5 large buildings where the centrifuge is located and would claim that it is a warehouse similar to the other 4.
Samsami provided street addresses of the suspect facilities.
ElBaradei planned to conduct inspections at the Natanz facility south of Tehran and at the Arak site southwest of Tehran on 22 February 2003 and 23 February 2003.
NCRI stated that the Arak site produces heavy water for the production of plutonium.
Plutonium is used as a trigger in nuclear weapons.
Samsami stated that such weapons are a matter of survival for the regime in Iran.
Samsami stated that Iran's clerical regime is in a tenuous position facing unprecedented social disenchantment and expansion of popular resistance and would therefore not hesitate to use weapons of mass destruction to stabilize its position.
The Government of Iran revealed earlier this month that it had discovered uranium deposits near the central city of Yazd and that a uranium oxide plant had been completed in the central city of Isfahan and would be complemented by an enrichment plant now under construction near Kashan to its north.
The plant in Yazd Province would produce concentrated yellow cake uranium while another facility at an undisclosed location would complete the cycle by producing finished fuel made entirely in Iran.

The International Narcotics Control Board reported on February 26, 2003 that illicit manufacture of methamphetamines has risen significantly in Southeast Asia.
The International Narcotics Control Board reported on February 26, 2003 that illicit manufacture of methamphetamines has risen significantly in Southeast Asia.
The United Nations organ said there continues to be indications that manufacturers of heroin are increasingly shifting their attention to methamphetamine particularly in Myanmar.
The Vienna-based Board stated that the psychotropic substance is clandestinely manufactured on a large scale along Myanmar's border with Thailand and in China and the Philippines.
Methamphetamine remains the main drug of concern in Japan, the Philippines and Thailand.
The Thai health ministry has estimated that three million people regularly abuse the substance.
That is five percent of the Thailand's population.
Thailand is the world's largest consumer of methamphetamines.
Authorities in Japan have reported a rise in the abuse of stimulants.
The Board stated that a sharp rise in methamphetamine abuse has also been noted in Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia and Vietnam.
In China there has been a rise in arrests related to the drug.
The report stated that the abuse of amphetamines among children has risen sharply in Cambodia.
Law enforcement efforts apprehended amphetamines in East Asia.
The UN organ stated that more than 70 percent of all the seizures in amphetamines made in the world took place in East and Southeast Asia, mainly China and Thailand.
Most of the world manufacture of amphetamine-type stimulants has taken place in the region.
The exception is MDMA (Ecstasy).
The report stated production of methamphetamine poses a growing threat to other regions.
Seizures of the drug have increased in Europe and the United States.
Illicit opium poppy cultivation decreased in Laos and Myanmar.
The Board said that the region still witnesses massive amounts of trafficking.
The region remains the second largest source of opium and heroin in the world behind Afghanistan.
The report said intravenous drug abuse has become one of the driving forces behind the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the region.
The Board told Indonesia, Myanmar and the Philippines to enforce without delaying laws passed over the last couple of years in the three countries.
This referred to an issue closely related to the illicit drugs trade, namely money-laundering and was to combat the practice.
The Board voiced concern that Cambodia and North Korea have yet to become parties to any of the international drug control treaties.

Kashmiri militant groups claim responsibility for attack on Indian police post in the disputed region that killed at least 11 people.
Indian officials claim that foreign infiltrators from Pakistan executed the attack but local Kashmiri groups call this baseless propaganda.
On 16 March 2003 Kashmiri militants claimed responsibility for an attack on a police post in the disputed state of Kashmir in India stating that they attacked to avenge the killing of their commanders by Indian troops.
The Hizbul Mujahideen is the largest group fighting Indian rule in the disputed Himalayan region.
A spokesman for Hizbul Mujahideen who declined to be identified stated to AFP --
The attack was in retaliation to the recent killing of district commander Amanullah and 3 other fighters of Hizbul Mujahideen by the Indian army in Kashmir.
Approximately 10 to 15 fighters from Hizbul Mujahideen, Harkatul Mujahideen, Harkatul Jihad-e-Islami and Al Badar attacked the camp before midnight on 15 March 2003 and into 16 March 2003 and killed at least 12 soldiers.
All the fighters who participated in the operation were local Kashmiris not infiltrators from Pakistan as claimed by Indian officials.
The Indian claim that cross-border incursions have increased is baseless and aimed at covering up its failures in occupied Kashmir.
The militants attacked the post in Gool in the Udhampur district approximately 95 miles north of Indian Kashmir's winter capital Jammu.
At least 11 people were killed in the attack.
A spokesman for another Kashmiri separatist group called Harkatul Mujahideen agreed with the Hizbul official stating --
The attack was executed by local Kashmiri fighters affiliated with 4 groups.
If India blames foreign militants it is part of its propaganda to mislead the international community.
The Kashmir region is divided between India and Pakistan and is claimed by both.
India and Pakistan have fought 2 wars over Kashmir since each gained independence from Britain in 1947.
India accuses Pakistan of funding and training rebels fighting to end Indian rule in Kashmir.
Pakistan denies the charge.
Since 1989 more than 37500 people have died in the insurgency in Kashmir.

Kazakhstan increased its air defenses to prevent any missiles fired during the Iraq war from threatening its Caspian coast.
The coast is a home to vital oil industry installation.
On March 21, 2003 a spokesman for the Central Asian country's defense ministry said Kazakhstan increased its air defenses to prevent any missiles fired during the Iraq war from threatening its Caspian coast.
The coast is a home to vital oil industry installation.
Defense ministry spokesman abish smailov told AFP that incidents occur when powerful weapons such as Scud missiles are used.
Smailov said that Kazakh air space is controlled at all times using measures involving anti-missile defenses, fighter jets and anti-terrorist units.
Kazakhstan's increased air defenses come during Kazakhstan's air force carries out exercises along its Caspian shores.
The shores are a center of Kazakhstan's nascent oil industry.
Western countries said it is inadequately defended in the event of terrorist attack.
Ex-Soviet Kazakhstan is separated from Iraq by a 600-kilometer (360-mile) section of the Caspian Sea and Iranian territory.
Kazakhstan is currently cooperating with the United States on strengthening defenses in this oil-rich area.
Kazakh politicians said that any overthrow of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein could reduce Western interests in exploiting Kazakhstan's oil fields.
Investors could turn their attention to Iraq's vast oil resources instead.

Several million Thai people use the drug.
The methamphetamine pills known as Yaa BAA have surpassed heroin as Thailand's number one killer drug.
Several million Thai people use the drug.
The pill has become part of Thai society.
No other drug has become as integral in decades.
The effects on the brains of its consumers is disastrous.
Yaa BAA is known as crazy medicine in Thailand.
It has been targeted in a two-month anti-drugs crackdown that has resulted in the deaths of nearly 1,900 suspected traffickers.
There is much concern over the drug.
The drug's popularity increased in the mid-1990s.
It has made Thailand the world's number one consumer.
Pierre-Arnaud chouvy and Joel meissonnier state in their book Yaa BAA recently published by the Institute of Research on contemporary Southeast Asia that the psychotropic drugs is used across society for both work and pleasure.
Construction workers, sailors, farmers and taxi drivers take the drug to help them through long working days.
Students use it to get through exam periods.
Clubbers use it to help them dance all night.
Yaa BAA possesses several qualities that have helped it supplant heroin as the drug of choice in Thailand.
The book states that the drug conveys a completely positive image.
It appears modern and inoffensive because it is synthetic.
The energy, confidence and euphoric feeling has given users an image as a drug of happiness.
The pills can also be easily consumed.
They can be popped or dissolved in a glass of water, taken intravenously, pulverized and inhaled, or smoked.
There are at least 90 types of the pill.
Yaa BAA is easy to manufacture and do not have any climate uncertainties like other drugs have.
Instructions on how to manufacture the drug are available on the Internet.
Heroin requires opium poppy as its raw ingredient and cocaine depends on yields from the coca plant.
The drug has an affordable price.
It cost 60 baht (1.50 dollars) per pill on the streets before Thailand's drug war started on February 1, 2003 and push the price up 300 percent.
The pill costs five-cents to produce.
800 million pills entered Thailand from Myanmar last year.
The book states that the majority of the drug comes from Myanmar particularly the areas controlled by the Wa of the UWSA (United Wa State Army).
The book is referring to the pro-Yangon ethnic group said to operate around 50 laboratories close to the border and the mobile production units.
Myanmar could become an unrivaled regional producer because of the links between the military rulers and the UWSA, and the jungle canopy where UWSA operate.
The military and UWSA links result in a lack of law enforcement.
The drug has become a specialty of the Golden Triangle where Thailand, Laos and Myanmar converge.
Much of the world's opium is still produced there.
Chouvy and meissonnier say that methamphetamine is overtaking heroin as the production drug of choice in the area and is profiting enormously from the distribution networks that heroin trafficking has already established.
Five percent of Thailand's population is now estimated to abuse methamphetamine.
The International Narcotics Control Bureau says the figure makes it the largest per capita consumer in the world.
The drug has been around in other forms for years.
It was first used in the 1920s as an antidepressant and then as a psychostimulant during World War II and the Vietnam War.
People recruited from impoverished ethnic minorities transport the pills along a multitude of routes.
Myanmar soldiers and Thai police and bureaucrats protect the cargo and allow them to eventually reach consumers in Thailand.
The books states that one pill will pass through seven intermediaries from the frontier runner to the retailer.
The retailer will usually sell more to the drug user than he or she requires.
This creates another dealer and explains the drug's easy availability across Thailand.
Owners of boats in the southern coastal province of Ranong and construction foremen in Bangkok are known to force their workers to take the drug at the beginning of the workday.
Occasionally in rural areas the farmers dissolve the drug in a bottle which they drink while working.
Consumers are as young as seven and school has become one of the main hubs for trafficking of methamphetamine.
Thailand's youth are the most at risk.

Afghanistan's Interior Minister states that Taliban is not capable of destabilizing the Afghan government despite post-winter increase in attacks on government and foreign targets in the country.
Most of the attacks are carried out by Pakistan-based former Taliban members sent into Afghanistan and funded by drug smuggling operations or supporters in Pakistan.
On 03 April 2003 Afghanistan's Interior Minister Ali Ahmad Jalali stated that Taliban and remaining al-Qaeda militants are not capable of destabilizing the Afghan government despite their increased attacks on government and foreign targets.
Jalali was speaking at his first press conference since taking office in February 2003.
Jalali stated that the arrival of spring weather was the reason for the increased number of attacks by Taliban and remaining members of Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network.
The traditional fighting season in Afghanistan is spring after the harsh winters.
Jalali stated that due to the warmer spring weather terrorist activities have increased particularly in the south and southeast regions of Afghanistan.
On 02 April 2003 the U.S. State Department stated that security in Afghanistan was volatile and unpredictable following a series of attacks against foreigners.
In a travel advisory the U.S. State Department stated that travel in all areas of Afghanistan including the capital Kabul is unsafe due to military operations, land mines, banditry, armed rivalry among political and tribal groups, and the possibility of terrorist attacks including attacks using vehicular or other bombs.
Taliban and al-Qaeda militants regularly launch attacks on government and foreign targets.
Last week a foreign Red Cross worker was murdered and 2 U.S. special forces were killed in an ambush while on patrol.
Jalali stated --
On 03 April 2003 Afghan militia forces were fighting Taliban extremists for the 3rd day near Spin Boldak in southern Kandahar province near the Pakistani border.
There are approximately 50-60 terrorists in the mountains of the southern Kandahar province and the Kandahar security forces are conducting operations against them.
On 02 April 2003 2 members of the security forces were killed and 1 was wounded.
7 of the terrorists were arrested.
Several former Taliban members were arrested in another operation in southern Ghazni province.
Jalali stated that among the former Taliban members arrested were several well-known former Taliban figures who were in Afghanistan to establish a network of terrorist organizations and to conduct anti-government activities in the area.
Among those arrested was former Taliban Education Minister Shaheed Kheil.
Jalali stated --
Approximately 15 suspected Taliban members were captured in Kandahar and 9 killed in operations launched after the 27 March 2003 murder of the Red Cross worker.
Most of the terrorist attacks are carried out by former Taliban members based across the border in Pakistan.
These members have confessed that they were sent from Pakistan into Afghanistan by the former Taliban leader.
The Pakistan-based former Taliban members conducting the attacks were being funded by former drug smuggling operations or by supporters in Pakistan.
The militants coming across the border from Pakistan into Afghanistan are organized by former Taliban elements.
Funds are transferred to the Pakistan-based former Taliban members from Karachi, Quetta and Peshawar but this does not indicate that the Government of Pakistan is supporting the former Taliban.
It is true that the interrogated Afghan Taliban stated that they had come from Pakistan and received their financial support from Karachi and Quetta but this does not indicate that the Government of Pakistan is supporting them.
There are many fundamentalists across the world as well as in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

A purported Ayman al-Zawahiri recording called for more suicide attacks, highlighting again the role of Egyptians in al-Qaeda, while suspicions grow that another Egyptian, Seif al-Adel, may have been behind the bombings in Saudi Arabia.
In a message aired 030521 by Arabic Qatar's Al-Jazeera satellite channel, the purported voice of Ayman al-Zawahiri urged Muslims to force Westerners out of Muslim lands by attacking westerners and emulating the 010911 suicide attacks in the United States.
The speaker called for Muslims to muster their resolve and hit the embassies of America, England, Australia and Norway, and strike at the interests, companies and employees of America, England, Australia and Norway.
The speaker urged Muslims to attack and eject Americans, British, Australians and Norwegians out of Muslim homelands.
The speaker told Muslims not to allow Americans, British, Australians, Norwegians or other Western Christians to live in and benefit from the resources of Muslim countries.
Egyptian experts said this audiotape was a genuine recording of Zawahiri's voice and proved Zawahiri was alive and still as influential as before in al-Qaeda.
Montasser al-Zayat, a lawyer who has represented Islamic militant suspects in Egypt, stated he was certain that the voice on the tape was that of Zawahiri, Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden's top lieutenant.
Al-Zayat stated that the recording was Zawahiri's voice, style and manner.
Dia al-Rashwan stated that he believed that the voice was Zawahiri's and that the message bore Zawahiri's characteristic emphasis on Islamic militant attacks against Arab governments which are allied to the United States.
Al-Rashwan is a journalist with Egypt's government daily Al-Ahram and an expert on Islamic militants.
According to Rashwan, while bin Laden has always stressed international targets, Zawahiri has gradually shown increasing support for Arab targets as well.
Rashwan thought it was clear that Zawahiri is still second in command of al-Qaeda and that his stress on local (Arab) targets was influencing not only statements and actions by Al-Qaeda itself but also groups inspired by them.
Montasser al-Zayat said that he believed bin Laden was under secure protection with Zawahiri.
Zayat thought that security conditions sometimes dictate which one speaks out.
The situations and locations of Zawahiri, bin Laden and other top al-Qaeda members have been unknown since the United States struck the bases of al-Qaeda and its Taliban supporters in Afghanistan in 011000.
Rashwan was unable to illuminate suspicions that Seif al-Adel, another Egyptian, might have masterminded the triple suicide bombings that killed 34 people, including 9 bombers, in Riyadh, Suadi Arabia 030512.
Rashwan and other Egyptian experts said that Adel has become Al-Qaeda's number 3 in command since becoming chief of military operations and succeeding Abu Hafs al-Masri.
Al-Masri was killed during the war in Afghanistan.
Adel was a top member in the Egyptian Islamic militant movement Al-Jihad.
Al-Jihad was led by Zawahiri and carried out many attacks in Egypt in the 1990s.
Adel left Egypt at the end of the 1980s for a Gulf Arab country, then traveled to Pakistan and then Afghanistan, where he helped train militants at some camps, Egyptian sources said on condition they not be named.
The Egyptian sources also said that Adel is close to both Zawahiri and bin Laden.
A senior Saudi official said 030519 that he believed Adel directed the bombings in Riyadh.
A senior United States official stated that it was still not clear whether Adel had personally been involved.
Like Zawahiri, Adel and Al-Masri were on a list of 12 most wanted suspects released by the US administration following the 010911 attacks.
At least three other Egyptians were also on the list: Tharwat Salah Shehata, Tariq Anwar As-Sayyid Ahmad and Mohammad Salah.
Egyptian security sources said that Ahmad and Salah were killed in the war on terror launched after 010911.
Ahmad and Salah were believed to have organized suicide attacks.

Indian troops already fighting rebels in Kashmir are now engaged in a massive campaign to destroy poppy crops in the region.
Troops are facing angry farmers unaware that poppy cultivation is now punishable as a drug trafficking offense.
Customs officials from the Federal Finance Ministry launched the campaign with security forces on 15 May 2003 in the southern Kashmir already affected by much violence.
The campaign requires troops to confront angry residents desperate to earn a living and unaware they are violating the law.
A similar drive was carried out in 2002 in the same region but did not stop residents from replanting.
Prabhakar stated --
The crop destruction of 2002 has not served as a deterrent.
The State administration has been lax on the issue.
No district official has ever taken steps to destroy the crop nor even reported that poppy crops are grown in his area.
Villagers in this region approximately 30 kilometers (18 miles) south of Kashmir's summer capital Srinagar stated that cultivating poppy crops was their only livelihood.
Farmer Ghulam Ahmed stated that he and other farmers have been growing poppy crops in their fields for years with no objection from anyone.
Ahmed stated that residents were shocked when officials and troops started destroying their harvest.
Many villagers grow poppy for their seeds used to flavor the Kashmiri bread known as kulcha.
Bakers buy the seeds at 100 rupees (two U.S. dollars) per kilogram.
The lucrative byproduct is poppy SAP which can be processed into opium.
Rahti Begum was disconsolate as she watched her crop being destroyed.

24 June 2003 -- a Paris judge ordered that 11 members of Iranian armed opposition group the People's Mujahedeen remain imprisoned.
Court sources stated that the members were placed under investigation for terrorist offenses.
The members include the People's Mujahedeen's symbolic leader Maryam Rajavi.
The People's Mujahedeen views Rajavi as the President-elect of a future Iranian government.
The judge rejected Rajavi's appeal that the 11 members be freed from preventive detention.
On 22 June 2003 17 members of the People's Mujahedeen were placed under judicial investigation.
The 17 members included Rajavi.
The investigation is the first step toward formal criminal charges for alleged links between the People's Mujahedeen and a terrorist organization and for funding terrorist activity.
Last week French police raided more than a dozen locations linked to the People's Mujahedeen northwest of Paris.
Paris officials have accused the People's Mujahedeen of using France as a rear base to plan attacks against Iranian interests.
A series of demonstrations in Paris and Europe protested the raids.
10 people set themselves on fire at the raids.
A woman in Paris and a woman in London died from injuries incurred by setting themselves on fire.
Several dozen supporters staged a hunger strike at the headquarters of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI).
More than 10 of the hunger strikers have been treated in hospital for dehydration.
Approximately 160 people have been detained in the police crackdown on the People's Mujahedeen.
.
The People's Mujahedeen has been classified by the US, the EU and Iran as a terrorist organization.
The People's Mujahedeen armed wing occupying bases in Iraq have been neutralized by US forces.
The People's Mujahedeen has accused French authorities of carrying out their operation as part of a deal with Iran.
Iran denies having such a deal with France.
The NCRI is the People's Mujahedeen's political front in Auvers-sur-Oise.
Hunger strikers were affected by France's heat wave.
Temperatures in Auvers-sur-Oise have reached 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit).

A 5 billion United States dollar North Korean nuclear reactor project is contingent upon progress of discussions between North Korea and South Korea regarding North Korea's desire to obtain nuclear weapons.
Charles Kartman stated on 030630 that the 5 billion United States dollar North Korean nuclear reactor project is contingent upon progress of discussions between North Korea and South Korea regarding North Korea's desire to obtain nuclear weapons.
Officials stated that Charles Kartman made the statement during talks with South Korean Foreign Minister Yoon Young-kwan.
Charles Kartman is executive director of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization.
Wi Sung-lac stated to reporters that Charles Kartman stated that the North Korean nuclear reactor project is linked to North Korea's problem with nuclear weapons.
Wi Sung-lac is the head of the South Korean Foreign Ministry's North American Affairs Bureau.
Wi Sung-lac stated that Charles Kartman stated that North Korea's participation in the multilateral talks proposed by the United States to settle the nuclear crisis would help Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization resolve any policy differences over the North Korean nuclear reactor project.
Wi Sung-lac stated that Japan seems to have taken a similar position to south Korea and that there seems to be no determined policy despite various opinions in the United States.
Wi Sung-lac refused to give any details about the North Korean nuclear reactor project.
The Yonhap News Agency stated that Charles Kartman would reaffirm that the North Korean nuclear reactor project may not be completed if the North Korean government continued to pursue a nuclear agenda.
The United States Government has reportedly suggested the North Korean nuclear reactor project be halted as part of growing diplomatic pressure on the South Korean government.
South Korea has so far taken a cautious stance on the issue of the North Korean nuclear reactor project.
The Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization was created under a 940000 Agreed Framework between North Korea and the United States.
The Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization was to provide North Korea with 2 light-water nuclear reactors deemed unsuitable for weapons production and 500000 metric tons of heavy fuel oil per year.
Construction on the 2 light-water nuclear reactors started in 020800 and is already behind schedule.
Construction on 1 of the 2 light-water nuclear reactors was originally planned to be completed in 030000.
The Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization has maintained construction work on the 2 light-water nuclear reactors and has suspended shipments of fuel oil to North Korea from 021200 at the height of the nuclear stand-off which intensified in 021000 when the North Korean government admitted to running a nuclear weapons program based on enriched uranium.
The 940000 Agreed Framework between North Korea and the United States required North Korea to stop the use of graphite-moderate reactors used to produce weapons-grade plutonium at North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear plant.
North Korea did not adhere to the 940000 agreed framework.
North Korea unsealed spent fuel rods from the graphite-moderate reactors, removed International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors and withdrew from a nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
On 030609 North Korea admitted publicly for the first time that North Korea was seeking nuclear weapons capability.
United States officials do not know how far North Korea's nuclear weapons program has progressed.
United States officials believe the North Korean government has already stockpiled enough plutonium for 1 or 2 nuclear weapons.
North Korea and the United States sat down for their first talks in three-way negotiations with China in 030400 but no further meetings have been scheduled.
United States government is seeking support from its allies to cut North Korea's alleged funding from the sales of arms, illegal drugs and currency counterfeiting.
North Korea has accused the United States of planning a blockade of North Korea.

Vietnam state media reported on 1 July 2003 that an Australian man of Vietnamese origin and a Lao National were arrested after Vietnamese police uncovered two networks trafficking drugs from Laos and Cambodia.
The Vietnam News Agency said Australian national Tran Van Thanh was arrested on 30 June 2003 in the southern Vietnam city of dalat for Tran's involvement in a network smuggling heroin from Cambodia to Australia via Vietnam.
The news agency reports that police transferred Tran to Ho Chi Minh City where Tran's Vietnamese accomplice, Pham Dai Nhon, was arrested on 29 June 2003 with more than 600 grams (1.3 pounds) of heroin.
Anti-drug police on 1 July 2003 also arrested a Lao National named khamkhuong unmano as police broke up a gang trafficking the psychoactive pharmaceutical bromazepam from Laos to Vietnam.
Unmano's wife and unmano's brother and sister-in-law were 3 of unmano's Vietnamese partners and were arrested on 30 June 2003 in Hanoi.
The 2 couples told police they had trafficked more than 60000 pills of bromazepam.
Police also seized more than 90000 pills of bromazepam, a car and close to 40000 US dollars following a raid at the unmanos' houses.
Vietnam has some of the strictest drug laws in the world.
Anyone found in possession of 300 grams (10 ounces) or more of heroin or 10 kilograms (22 pounds) or more of opium could face the death penalty.

The Swedish Government appointed Hans Blix to head a new independent international commission on weapons of mass destruction on July 3, 2003.
The Swedish government on July 3, 2003 appointed Hans Blix to head a new independent commission on weapons of mass destruction.
Anna Lindh stated that it is very gratifying that Hans Blix is willing to accept the chairmanship because the experience and knowledge Hans Blix possesses is unique.
Anna Lindh stated that the Commission would provide impetus to disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missiles.
Anna Lindh stated that the Commission will be formed in the fall of 2003 and will submit recommendations in 2005.
Hans Blix is the former United Nations weapons chief inspector in Iraq.
Hans Blix retired from the United Nations post on June 30, 2003.
Hans Blix is also a former Minister for Foreign Affairs and directed the Chairman of the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission for 3 years.
The Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh stated that Sweden must do everything possible to avert the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction.
In July 2003 the Foreign Ministry of Sweden was opening a new section specializing in disarmament.
Anna Lindh stated the opening of the new section is one more way to express the Swedish Government's commitment in disarmament.
Lindh also expressed hope for Sweden to succeed in spreading knowledge of and arousing further interest in issues concerning disarmament.
The United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission began working in Iraq in November 2003 after the regime of former president Saddam Hussein gave way to the threat of United States military action.
Hans Blix stated that he had been undermined by individuals in the Pentagon because the individuals issued criticism in the U.S. press regarding Hans Blix's cautious approach and failure to locate any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
Hans Blix stated that the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission did not have enough time to complete inspection before the United States led invasion in Iraq.
Hans Blix also stated that fact that the United States was now calling for patience while completing a United States led search for the suspected weapons was ironic.
The United Nations Monitoring, Verification, and inspection group was set up in December 1999.

The Chinese government's recent conclusion that North Korea has enough plutonium to build a nuclear bomb has resulted in urgent diplomacy and plans for new talks.
Chinese deputy foreign minister was dispatched to North Korea to meet with Kim Jong-Il in an attempt to deescalate the situation.
Chinese diplomats were quoted in the Asian Wall Street Journal on 18 July 2003 as stating that China believes North Korea currently has enough plutonium to build a nuclear bomb.
This belief caused the Government of China to accelerate diplomacy to resolve the crisis and to dispatch Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Dai Bingguo to Pyongyang, North Korea on 12 July 2003 in this effort.
China is North Korea's closest ally.
North Korea is a Stalinist regime.
Dai is presently in Washington D.C. to inform top U.S. policymakers of the outcome of the rare meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il.
The newspaper stated that in recent weeks Chinese intelligence services concluded that North Korea is producing weapons-grade plutonium in sufficient quantities and possesses all the necessary components to assemble nuclear-tipped missiles.
A European official familiar with internal Chinese reports on the findings and Chinese diplomats were quoted in the newspaper as stating that the reprocessed plutonium is estimated to be sufficient to make at least 1 nuclear device.
The European official stated that North Korea has yet to combine the plutonium, triggering devices and other components into a bomb.
The Chinese reports in part verify recent claims made by the Government of North Korea that a number of spent nuclear fuel rods sealed in 1994 have been opened and have undergone reprocessing ostensibly to produce plutonium.
Until now China had stated that no evidence existed that North Korea was seeking nuclear weapons.
The U.S. government has been unable to confirm the North Korean government's claims.
U.S. and South Korean officials have speculated that North Korea may have 1 or 2 nuclear bombs and may have the capacity to build 6.
The Chinese government's increasing concern was made evident by the new urgency of its diplomacy this week.
At a foreign ministry briefing on 17 July 2003 spokesman Kong Quan stated that the North Korean crisis was at a critical point.
Kong Quan stated that China is attempting to deescalate the situation by promoting talks and encouraging the 2 parties to make peace.
Kong Quan stated that it is important that the parties return to negotiations and continue with the trilateral talks that commenced in April 2003.
The trilateral talks of April ended poorly with the North Korean government stating it possessed and might test nuclear weapons.
According to U.S. officials there is now a greater possibility that new talks could occur as North Korea appears willing to join another negotiating session with China and the United States.
There were also indications that the dialogue could be expanded to include Japan and South Korea.
South Korean officials have been quoted as saying that a dialogue could take place as early as August 2003.
The United States government has always insisted on multilateral talks and has been eager to include its Japanese and South Korean allies.
North Korea has consistently demanded 1-on-1 talks with the U.S. government.
The Government of China emphasizes that it is more important to resume talks quickly than to refrain until the number of participants can be agreed upon.
China is a traditional ally and supplier of food and fuel to North Korea China and is therefore the country with the most leverage over North Korea.
China has demonstrated that it is willing to take advantage of this leverage.
Earlier in the crisis China stopped oil supplies to North Korea for several days.
2 days after North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il granted Dai the rare meeting for 14 July 2003 the regime's Korean Central News Agency announced that China had recently decided to donate 10000 tons of diesel oil to North Korea.

Thailand will host ministers from China, Laos, India and Myanmar to discuss the elimination of precursor chemicals used in drug production.
Officials report that ministers from China, Laos, India, Myanmar and Thailand will hold talks this week in the northern Thai town of Chiang Rai aimed at eliminating precursor chemicals used in drug production.
The meeting will take place from 22 July 2003 - 25 July 2003 in one of the corners of the Golden Triangle and is the first of its kind.
The meeting will be attended by the ministers responsible for drug suppression in China, Laos, India, Myanmar and Thailand.
Thai Justice Minister pongthep Thepkanjana will host the meeting.
Deputy chief of Thailand's office of Narcotics Control Board (ONCB) rasanee Vistaveth stated the ministers from China, Laos, India, Myanmar and Thailand are expected to adopt the Chiang Rai Declaration which will touch on the countries' commitment to solving the problem of drugs, particularly with regard to precursors and chemical trafficking.
Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are contained in legal medicines and are used to produce illegal stimulants including speed or ice which are produced in large quantities in Myanmar and then trafficked to Thailand and China and beyond.
Chemical precursors are also used to turn raw opium into heroin.
Rasanee stated the ministers from China, Laos, India, Myanmar and Thailand expect to openly discuss their countries' weak points and the measures each country is taking to control these substances and prevent the substances from reaching the Golden Triangle area.
Rasanee said the governments of China, Laos, India, Myanmar and Thailand will explore ways to cooperate to intercept the illegal substances which are also used in legitimate industries.
Rasanee stated every country has its own way of controlling precursors but as matter of fact many precursors still flood the Golden Triangle area.
The ministers from China, Laos, India, Myanmar and Thailand will also address crop substitution initiatives for impoverished ethnic minorities who still rely on opium cultivation.
Rasanee referred to Thailand's successful decades-long campaign to eliminate poppy growing from its territory and reported that Thailand is willing to help and share its own expertise on opium elimination by training officials.
The ministers from China, Laos, India, Myanmar and Thailand will discuss how to find markets for goods produced under crop substitution and other related programs such as eco-tourism and handicraft manufacturing.

La times probe finds strong evidence that Iran appears to be in the late stages of developing the capacity to build a nuclear bomb.
The Los Angeles Times in the 030804 edition Summarized results of an independent probe which strongly indicated that Iran is striving to become the world's next nuclear power and appears to be in the late stages of developing the capacity to build a nuclear bomb.
The Los Angeles Times said the 3-month investigation drew on previously secret reports, international officials, independent experts, Iranian exiles and intelligence sources and uncovered strong evidence that Iran's commercial program masked a military undertaking.
The Times report said that scientists from Russia, China, North Korea and Pakistan plus advancing technology have propelled Iran's nuclear program much closer to producing a bomb than Iraq ever was.
The Times pointed out that some experts predict Iran might produce an initial atomic weapon in the next 2-3 years.
No one is certain about the actual time frame for Iran's nuclear weapon production.
Nuclear materials:
The Times said a confidential report prepared by the French Government in 030500 concluded that Iran is surprisingly close to having enriched uranium or plutonium for a bomb.
A foreign intelligence service provided a copy of the report to the times.
The French government warned other governments in the report to exercise the most serious vigilance on their exports to Iran and Iranian front companies.
The Times report said that samples of uranium taken by UN inspectors in Iran in 030600 tested positive for enrichment levels high enough to be consistent with an attempt to build a nuclear weapon.
The Iranian government also secretly imported 1.8 tons of nuclear material from China in 910000 and processed some of this nuclear material in order to manufacture uranium metal.
This uranium would be of no use in Iran's commercial program but would be integral to weapons production.
foreign scientists' involvement:
The Times quoted an unnamed Middle Eastern intelligence official that Pakistan's role was bigger than thought from the beginning.
Abdul Qadeer Khan has helped Iran for years and is a Pakistani nuclear scientist regarded by the United States as a purveyor of nuclear secrets.
The Times said people inside Iran and foreign intelligence officials say that North Korean military scientists had been recently monitored entering Iranian nuclear facilities and are assisting in the design of a nuclear warhead.
There is a resort on the Caspian coast set aside for the exclusive use of North Koreans who are working on nuclear and missile projects in Iran.
This indicates the number of North Koreans working in Iran on such projects.
Russian scientists sometimes travel to Iran under false identities and work without the Russian government's approval to help complete a special reactor that could produce weapons-grade plutonium.
New technology:
The report said Iranians have also approached European companies in recent months to buy devices that can manipulate large volumes of radioactive material.
This technology is for forging uranium metal and plutonium and switches that could trigger a nuclear weapon.
European intelligence sources said list of items the Iranians have wished to procure was a strong indication that Iran has moved to the late stages of weapons development.

Iran pledges to provide nuclear information to IAEA and sign nuclear protocol before 20040200 but not to indefinitely suspend uranium enrichment
20031129 Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council and senior Iranian nuclear official Hassan Rowhani stated --
By 20040200 when director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency of the UN Mohammed El-Baradei presents a new report Iran will provide all required information and means of verification to the IAEA.
The Iranian government will soon authorize its representative to the IAEA to sign the additional protocol to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
20031126 the IAEA passed a resolution condemning Iran for 18 years of covert nuclear activities.
The resolution contained a passage warning that any further non-proliferation breaches by Iran would occasion stern action.
The US demanded that the Iranian government be brought before the UN Security Council for possible sanctions while Britain, France and Germany demanded that Iran be rewarded for cooperating with the IAEA since 20031000 but neither demand was met by the resolution.
Prior to 20031129 Rowhani had made no statement after the 20031126 IAEA resolution.
Rowhani stated --
The suspension of uranium enrichment is provisional and voluntary and intended to build confidence.
Iran continues to refuse to indefinitely suspend its uranium enrichment activities and reserves the right to recommence enrichment at any moment.
Iran's uranium enrichment has prompted international concern that Iran may be capable of constructing an atomic bomb.
Iran stated that the purpose its nuclear activities is peaceful.
Rowhani stated that Iran wants to use enriched uranium to supply fuel for a future civil center.
Rowhani stated that the Iranian government will discuss with European governments the transfer of modern technology, nuclear technology and fuel to Iran.
An unprecedented mission by the foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany in 20031000 convinced the Iranian government to --
Declare the entirety of the country's nuclear activities.
Suspend uranium enrichment.
Sign the NPT additional protocol allowing stricter inspections of Iranian nuclear facilities.

German technology group Siemens stated that negotiations had begun between Siemens and China to export an unused plutonium-processing facility to China.
On 031202 a German technology group named Siemens stated that delicate negotiations had begun between Siemens and China to export an unused plutonium-processing facility to China and that the negotiations had support from Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
Gerhard Schroeder is currently visiting China.
News of the potential sale of the plutonium-processing facility came after Gerhard Schroeder met on 031201 with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao.
German government sources stated that Wen Jiabao expressed interest in the plutonium-processing facility during the 031201 meeting with Gerhard Schroeder and that Gerhard Schroeder then promised to study Wen Jiabao's request to purchase the plutonium-processing facility.
Gerhard Schroeder is on day 2 of a 3 day visit to China.
Gerhard Schroeder has visited China 5 times since 990000 and has focused the visits on boosting economic relations.
Gerhard Schroeder is accompanied by a strong business delegation including Siemens boss Heinrich von Pierer.
Any sale of plutonium-processing facility between China and Siemens is likely to be highly politically contentious and would need the approval of Gerhard Schroeder's centre-left ruling coalition.
Gerhard Schroeder's centre-left ruling coalition includes the environmentalist Greens.
A previous proposal to export the plutonium-processing facility to Russia collapsed in 010000 amid political concerns.
The political concerns were voiced by the Greens and others.
A Siemens spokesman in Germany stated that Heinrich von Pierer stated that Siemens was beginning talks with interested Chinese parties about a sale of the plutonium-processing facility.
A Siemens spokesman in Germany stated that Heinrich von Pierer stated that Gerhard Schroeder stated that Gerhard Schroeder is not against the sale of the plutonium-processing facility in principle.
A Siemens spokesman in Germany stated to the Agence France-Presse that Siemens was confident about the outcome of the talks to sell the plutonium-processing facility.
A Siemens spokesman in Germany refrained from commenting on the political aspect of the sale of the plutonium-processing facility.
A Siemens spokesman in Germany stated that export permission would be needed from the German Government and that the speed of any sale of the plutonium-processing facility would be contingent upon obtaining the correct political support.
A Chinese delegation has already inspected the plutonium-processing facility at Hanau in western Germany and Siemens has lodged an application for an export licence.
A spokeswoman for Germany's Federal exports office confirmed Siemens's application for an export licence had been lodged with Germany's Federal exports office.
A spokeswoman for Germany's Federal exports office stated to Agence France-Presse that the application for an export licence was being studied at ministerial level due to the political considerations involved.
The political aspect of the sale of the plutonium-processing facility will be difficult to negotiate.
The plutonium-processing facility is described as Europe's largest plutonium plant producing fuel for nuclear reactors and was completed in 910000 at a cost of 700 million euros.
The plutonium-processing facility never went into operation and was abandoned in 950000.
The Hanau plutonium-processing facility was abandoned after safety concerns.
Siemens stated that the Hanau plutonium-processing facility was also abandoned due to political difficulties at a time of growing debate about the future of nuclear power.
The Environment Minister of Hesse state was the Greens member Joschka Fischer who is now Germany's Foreign Minister.
Hesse state includes Hanau where the plutonium-processing facility is located.
The plutonium-processing facility is estimated to be worth about 50 million euros on 031202.
Siemens would not comment on the plutonium-processing facility's estimated value of 50 million euros.
The environmental group Greenpeace urged the German Government to refuse the sale of the plutonium-processing facility.
Greenpeace stated that any sale of the plutonium-processing facility would effectively mark a German contribution to political destabilisation in the Far East.
Greenpeace stated that the fuel of the plutonium-processing facility could be refined to extract weapons-grade material and that the plutonium-processing facility should be scrapped.

4 December 2003 German Defense Minister Peter Struck stated that Germany will export a plutonium facility to China only if China guarantees to use it only for peaceful purposes.
The export is controversial.
Struck spoke in an interview to the Neue Presse daily.
The ruling centre-left coalition has criticized the proposed sale of the plutonium facility.
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder stated earlier this week he will investigate China's request to buy the plutonium facility.
Schroeder recently visited China.
Struck stated --
Schroeder is correct to promise to examine the proposed exportation.
China must guarantee that the plutonium factory will not be used for military purposes but to produce atomic energy.
The sale is a highly emotional subject.
Struck is confident the coalition will settle its disagreements.
If China makes the guarantee struck will not be concerned about the sale of the facility.
Earlier on 4 December 2003 Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao stated --
A Chinese company discussed a possible sale of the facility with owner German technology group Siemens.
The facility would be used for civil purposes and has no military goal.
The facility would have nothing to do with non-proliferation issues.
The facility was completed in 1991.
The facility would have been Europe's largest plant producing fuel for atomic power stations.
The facility never went into operation.
In 1995 the facility was abandoned under pressure from environmentalist party the Greens.
The Greens party is now junior partner in Schroeder's coalition.
Senior green members such as co-leader Angelika Beer demand the sale to China be refused.
Germany is phasing out atomic energy for environmental reasons and senior green members state that it would be hypocritical of Germany to export an atomic energy facility.
According to press reports Greens Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer has agreed to a sale.
Some members of of Schroeder's Social Democrat Party protest the sale.
Schroeder has publicly expressed his support of the sale.
The plutonium facility is located in Hanau, western Germany.
Joschka Fischer is the Greens' most charismatic figure.

Al-Qaeda officer Mohammed Hamdi al-Ahdal reveals under interrogation that Saudis and Yemenis were involved in funding two terrorist attacks in Yemen.
Sources close to the investigation said on 031216 that al-Qaeda officer Mohammed Hamdi al-Ahdal has revealed under interrogation that unnamed Saudis and Yemenis were involved in funding two terrorist attacks in Yemen.
Saudi-born adhal's alias is Abu Issam al-Maki and was al-Qaeda's leader in Yemen.
Ahdal was arrested 031100.
Ahdal revealed that the financing of the attacks against the USS Cole in 001000 and the French supertanker Limburg in 021000 October and other terrorist attacks went through Ahdal and originated from Saudis and Yemenis residing outside.
Ahdal told investigators the money came in installments and in small quantities in order to avoid detection.
Ahdal told the investigators all the financial and technical preparations for the attacks of both the USS Cole and Limburg were supervised by Ahdal and revealed that one of the two suicide bombers in the USS Cole attack carried the family name of Al-thore.
The Saudi-owned Al-majala weekly magazine's current edition said that Saudis and Yemenis were implicated in the terrorist attacks in Yemen.
Al-majala said the Government of Yemen informed Saudi authorities of information revealed by Ahdal under investigation reagrding Saudi persons involved in the funding and that Yemeni authorities are preparing to receive Saudi officers in joining the investigation.
Al-majala said Yemeni authorities refused a Saudi request asking for Ahdal to be extradited for interrogation in Saudi Arabia because the Yemeni Constitution disallows the handing over of Yemeni citizens regardless of any charges.
A Saudi team of investigators is currently in Yemen.
Yemeni authorities believe Ahdal is the second-in-command to Ali Qaed Sunian al-Harithi.
Ali Qaed Sunian al-Harithi's alias was Abu Ali al-Harithi.
Harithi was among the six al-Qaeda suspects killed in November 021100 in a missile attack by the US Central Intelligence Agency in the desert region of Al-Naqaa east of Sanaa in Marib province.
Yemen is the ancestral homeland of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and has been under pressure from the US government since the 010911 attacks on the US to crack down on presumed Al-Qaeda militants.

Live poultry smuggling undermines WHO and FAO efforts to restrict bird flu spread in Asia.
FAO and WHO advise countries to tighten border security.
Smugglers are undermining international efforts headed by the UN World Health Organization (WHO) and Agricultural Organization (FAO) to eradicate bird flu by trafficking illegal live poultry that threaten to spread the disease to new areas.
Attempts to halt bird flu spread --
Agriculture and customs officials have increased border checks throughout the affected region to halt illicit trade.
Recent arrests of live poultry smugglers have occurred at checkpoints.
Most affected Asian countries have banned the import and export of live and slaughtered poultry to prevent the movement of potentially infected chickens and ducks across borders.
Senior FAO Animal Production and Health Officer in Asia Hans Wagner stated --
The FAO is concerned and well aware that there is copious uncontrolled movement of animals between borders in some Asian countries.
Smuggling occurs chiefly across the Green or uncontrolled borders of Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar and China is likely a source for spreading the flu and other diseases.
Authorities in Vietnam stated that smuggling of meat and fruit from China has increased drastically in the past year.
Vietnam has experienced 9 flu fatalities and is the country worst affected by the disease.
Preventing smuggling from Vietnam is difficult because the country's extensive land borders with China, Laos and Cambodia are poorly controlled by a notoriously corrupt customs department.
Most nations have tightened border controls in accordance with FAO and WHO advisories.
20040120 Cambodian authorities detained 10 in the southern province of Ta KEO for importing over 150000 duck eggs from Vietnam.
Cambodia has continuously been combating chicken and egg smuggling from Vietnam and is on high alert.
20040202 Taiwan tightened security against smugglers following the discovery in 20031200 of H5N1 in ducks smuggled from mainland China.
Taiwan has previously successfully controlled an outbreak of the milder H5N2 flu strain.
Taiwanese coastguards increased patrols around the island and several island groups off the Chinese mainland.
Approximately 8000 poultry and pig farmers were vaccinated against human flu to prevent it mutating with bird flu strains.
India is free of the disease but has deployed hundreds of soldiers to the border with Myanmar.
Myanmar has no reported H5N1 cases but Indian officials suspect that poultry could be smuggled through Myanmar from Thailand.
Thailand is one of the countries worst affected by the virus.
Hong Kong authorities have increased security along the border with China.
The Government stated that illegally slaughtered poultry imports increased by 15 percent from 2002 to 2003.
The Customs and Excise Department reportedly seized 29266 kilograms of chilled or frozen poultry in 2003 compared with 1749 kilograms in 2002.
Customs spokesman Richard law stated that the Department performs frequent checks on smuggling activities and have now increased efforts to inspect cargoes.
The H5N1 flu strain has caused 13 deaths and reported outbreaks in 10 countries.

Volkswagen AG rejects a Chinese newspaper report that it had put a stop to technology transfers of its Santana sedans to joint venture partner Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp (SAIC).
The China Business Post reported 040209 that German auto giant Volkswagen AG had decided against the further transfer of a technical platform for the Santana sedan model to joint venture partner Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp (SAIC).
Discontinuing these technology transfers would cause several millions of yuan's of losses to SAIC.
The China Business Post said SAIC had invested large sums in the scheduled acquisition of the Platform, including acquiring an auto manufacturing plant in Yizheng city in eastern Jiangsu province.
The reported plan was for SAIC to produce a new sedan model designed on the Santana platform and with the car set to be launched in 040500.
The China Business Post said the termination was due in part to Volkswagen's adjustment of strategies regarding China and to ineffective communication with Volkswagen's Chinese partners.
Volkswagen on 040209 rejected this China Business Post report that Volkswagen had put a stop to technology transfers of Santana sedans to SAIC.
Volkswagen group China spokeswoman Melanie Behrens said that the statements made in the China Business Post about the stop of knowledge transfer from VW to SAIC are not true.
Behrens said that Volkswagen does not know where these claims came from and is still working on the subject and trying to clarify the situation.
SAIC was not immediately available for comment.
SAIC also has a joint venture with US-based General Motors.
Analysts said this issue highlights what might be an increasing problem for foreign auto makers as China's government increases support of domestic car companies in hopes of building stand-alone name brands.
Many Chinese car-makers with overseas venture partners have begun researching and developing cars independently.
Volkswagen is China's number one passenger car-maker and has two joint ventures in China, Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive Company and Faw (First Automotive Works) Volkswagen Automotive Company.
Approximately 633000 of Volkswagen's own cars were sold in China in 030000, up from 510000 in 020000.
SAIC sold a total of 800000 sedans in 030000.
SAIC's sedan sales topped other domestic auto makers, most of which are volkswagens and General Motors' buicks.

Foreign Minister Abdel Rahman Shalgam stated on 10 February 2004 during a visit to London that Libyan officials had all the means to make weapons of mass destruction but never decided to produce the weapons.
Shalgam's visit to London is the first by a Libyan foreign minister since 1969.
Shalgam stated during a press conference alongside British Foreign Minister Jack Straw that Libyan officials have had the equipment, the material, the know-how and the scientists to make weapons of mass destruction.
Shalgam stated that having flour, water and fire does not mean having bread.
Officials in Tripoli stated on 19 December 2003 that Libyan officials were abandoning Tripoli's weapons of mass destruction program following months of secret talks with British and U.S. officials.
Shalgam stated the program's abandonment was not imposed on Libyan officials.
Shalgam stated Libyan officials want American and British aid which would be more beneficial to Libya than making weapons of mass destruction.
Straw stated the Libyan officials' decision was a courageous step and that the announcement of the decision paved the way for the former pariah state of Libya's reintegration into the international community.
Straw stated that the announcement showed that problems of proliferation can with good will be tackled through discussion and engagement.
Straw stated the Libyan officials' decision should benefit the whole region and make the world a safer place.
Straw stated that progress was being made on moves to dismantle Libya's program following the announcement in December 2003.

A draft report prepared for the EU executive stated that the European Union should massively increase research on security issues in order to better protect civilians from terrorist attacks.
The report is created by a working group including Research Commissioner Philippe Busquin and enterprise Commissioner Erkki Liikanen.
It recommends that up to two billion euros be spent per year on a vast pan-European research program.
The European Security Research Program (ESRP) would receive EU funding beginning in 2007.
It is the most ambitious of several recommendations the group is likely to issue when it presents its final conclusions in two or three weeks.
The draft report recommends starting security research funding with one billion euros per year in 2007.
It will then slowly increase the annual budget to two billion euros.
European spending currently lags behind the United States.
The United States' Homeland Security Department receives one billion dollars annually plus research credit from the Defense Department.
The report stated that there is no reason why European Security Research should not be funded at a level similar to the United States.
The European Commission strategy allows for a preliminary period of studies and pilot projects from 2004 to 2006.
It promotes EU-wide synergies in research on top safety issues including protection against bio-terrorism and improved networking between civilian and military authorities across the continent.
65 million euros have been earmarked for the 2004-2006 phase of the research program according to an exploratory Plan of Action presented by the Commission on February 3, 2004.
The Working Group on security research was formed last October and includes EU parliamentarians and experts from related industries in addition to the two commissioners.

French anti-terrorist judge calls terrorism serious threat despite dispersal and weakening of al-Qaeda.
Restraining extremist groups is becoming increasingly difficult because of how the groups are financed.
France's top anti-terrorist judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere stated to AFP 29 February 2004 that al-Qaeda is still capable of inspiring people to carry out attacks despite being much weaker since the 11 September 2001 attacks and the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan.
Bruguiere has led the French legal effort against extremism and terrorism in recent years.
Bruguiere stated --
The global fight against terrorism is against an increasingly elusive enemy with access to funds virtually impossible to control.
The threat comes from long-standing members of al-Qaeda.
Al-Qaeda is an organization which still exists but has been significantly weakened by the neutralization and capture of a number of its members and of those in charge.
In an interview in Monaco Bruguiere called global terrorism a scattered and polymorphous threat.
Bruguiere was in Monaco attending a meeting of the international organization involved in Mediterranean political studies called club of Monaco.
Dozens of alleged members of al-Qaeda have been captured or killed since the group claimed responsibility for the 11 September attacks on New York and Washington D.C. but authorities have not been able to locate al-Qaeda's leader Osama bin Laden or his top deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri.
On 24 February 2004 Zawahiri appeared in 2 taped messages broadcast by the Arab-language Al-Arabiya and Al-Jazeera television stations calling in remarks attributed to him for renewed attacks on the United States.
Bruguiere stated --
Restraining extremist groups particularly across Europe was becoming increasingly difficult because of how the groups are financed.
The networks operating in Europe benefit from micro-financing and not from macro-financing.
Fraudulent charge cards could be used to withdraw significant sums which are then distributed through micro-channels outside the classic financial circles and are practically impossible to detect.
Use of false credit cards is growing.
It is necessary to expand existing laws to combat the funding mechanisms.
All existing legal or institutional measures are insufficient to neutralize this threat.
Al-Qaeda is only 1 of many worldwide threats among the many radical Islamic organizations involved in an international jihad and sharing the al-Qaeda strategy that are pursuing regional options.
The groups are particularly active in Africa, Asia and Europe.
Bruguiere made these comments before going into a meeting with approximately 40 high-ranking or former top international officials.
Since the September 2001 strikes on the United States deadly large-scale attacks have occurred in other parts of the world.
Among the targets have been a synagogue in northern Tunisia, a nightclub in Bali, a hotel in Kenya and numerous locations in Chechnya and Russia.
Analysts have warned that Iraq could become a breeding ground for terrorist organizations if a political solution is not found soon.
The United States and Britain invaded Iraq nearly a year ago despite massive international opposition.

Amnesty International urges Laos to treat surrendered ethnic Hmong rebels humanely while Lao officials claim there are no rebels and no insurgency.
The rights group states that Lao troops promised rebels amnesty and a living area if they surrender but has received conflicting reports as to whether the Lao Government has upheld this agreement.
On 05 March 2004 Amnesty International called on the Lao Government to ensure that 100s of ethnic Hmong anti-government insurgents and their families who had reportedly surrendered were treated humanely.
From its London headquarters Amnesty International issued a statement saying that the Lao People's Democratic Republic has international obligations in this regard under the Geneva Conventions and the 2 UN covenants.
On 03 March 2004 the U.S. government-funded network Radio Free Asia reported --
Up to 700 insurgents and their relatives and 8 rebel commanders surrendered after government troops surrounded several northern holdouts in late February 2004.
Troops used leaflets and megaphones to help communicate to the rebels that authorities would grant them amnesty and a special living area if they surrendered.
Approximately 300 people surrendered near Luang Prabang after traveling on foot from farther north and between 300 and 400 people surrendered in Xieng Khouang province.
Amnesty International stated it had received conflicting reports as to their reception and treatment by the authorities.
Lao Foreign Ministry Spokesman Yong Chanthalangsy denied that anyone had surrendered insisting also that there were no rebels in the impoverished communist nation.
Yong Chanthalangsy told AFP that no one surrendered, that there are no rebels and there is no war in Laos.
Yong Chanthalangsy stated that there are many people coming out of the forests to take advantage of Lao poverty eradication programs.
Following a series of deadly highway ambushes and bomb blasts the Lao Government called in August 2003 on Hmong and others whom they called ethnic minority bandits to lay down their arms, to come out from the forest and to rejoin society.
The Lao Government warned that failure to do so would result in heavy consequences.
Small bands of ethnic minority rebels predominantly Hmong remain from the CIA-sponsored guerrilla army mobilized to wage the United States' secret campaign in Laos during the Vietnam War.
Some 300000 Hmong fled to Thailand after the Communist takeover in Laos in 1975 but the remaining rebels have continued a low-level, ineffective insurgency for nearly three decades.
The Lao military has been accused by human rights groups of using harsh and often brutal tactics to eliminate them.
Amnesty International called on the Lao Government to provide UN agencies and other non-governmental organizations access to all those who have put down their arms in order to assist with basic humanitarian needs.
Amnesty International stated --
Longer term assistance with their reintegration into Lao society will also be needed.
It is essential that neutral observers are given access to these groups of former rebels in order to independently assess their situation and the veracity of ongoing claims of serious human rights violations being made by overseas ethnic Hmong groups.
The Lao Government should seize this opportunity to find a peaceful solution to decades of fighting and the high human cost on all sides of the conflict.
In January 2004, U.S.-based Lao exiles warned that Lao forces had launched a new offensive against 1000s of Hmong rebels and civilians and accused the communist regime of using starvation as a weapon of war.

Desiring admission into the European Union, Albanian government increased efforts against drug trafficking by strengthening laws, seizing illegal drugs, and investigating possibly corrupt police officials.
Under the pressure of the European Union the Albanian Government has escalated its fight against drug trafficking by preparing a new strategy to halt the smuggling of hashish and heroin over Albanian territory from Asia towards the West.
A recent EU report on Albania stated the situation in Albania, which has remained an important country for the traffic of narcotics, is worrisome.
The report suggested the Tirana government adopt an efficient strategy in the Government's efforts against drug trafficking.
Albanian interior minister Igli Toska stated --
The fight against drug trafficking will be the Albanian government's main challenge in 2004.
The Albanian Government has been working on a project of national strategy which will require international support and cooperation.
Albania's geographic position, Albania's trade with Turkey and Greece, and the situation after the Kosovo war are all elements Albanian criminal groups profit from, thereby making Albania an important stop for the transit of narcotics.
In July 2004 the Albanian government plans to present a set of anti-Mafia laws which will allow confiscation of property belonging to persons involved in criminal and illegal activities.
Albanian justice minister Adrian dvorani stated the anti-Mafia laws also provide for the special protection of witnesses or people involved in illegal trafficking who decide to testify and will enable a more efficient strategy.
Albanian officials aspire to EU membership.
The Albanian government has made a significant development in the government's fight against drug smugglers in 2004.
In 2003 Albanian police infiltrated an international drug network operating between Kosovo, Macedonia, Albania and Italy and controlled by the Kosovo Albanian and Turkish criminal groups linked with the Calabrian Mafia organization N'Drangheta.
In May 2004 approximately 100 policemen -- 25 of them in top positions -- were dismissed on suspected ties with organized crime.
60 others have been investigated on similar charges.
Toska stated there will be no smugglers without corrupted policemen and Toska announced tougher measures against policemen and security officials linked with criminal groups.
The EU report quotes the names of several Albanian politicians directly or indirectly involved in drugs trafficking but no measures have so far been taken against the politicians.
Albanian police forces have seized more than 200 kilos (440 pounds) of heroin and around 8 tons of cannabis between November 2003 and May 2004, double that which was seized in 2003.
Experts say the figures of drugs seized are insignificant compared to the estimated quantities of narcotics that are smuggled through Albania.
International Police experts based in Tirana estimate the value of the narcotics in transit at over 2 billion dollars (about 1.6 billion euros) per year.
Experts estimate the amount smuggled through Albania makes up approximately 25 to 30 percent of the narcotics smuggled into the European market from the Balkans.
Albanian police official Xhavit Shala stated Albanian smugglers are linked to the international criminal organizations like (the Italian) sacra Corona UNITA, Cosa Nostra, the Turkish, Russian, Macedonian and Kosovar mafia, and the Colombian drug cartels.
Bujar Mema of the Albanian Interpol Office stated that drug smugglers have reappeared due to increasing consumption of narcotics in Europe and the production of opium from Afghanistan, which has reached the level of the years before the US intervention in 2001 with 3600 tons produced in 2003.

International diplomats witnessed the incineration.
The incinerated drugs had a total value of approximately 247 million dollars.
Myanmar's military rulers incinerated the drugs to mark the International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking.
One of the heads Myanmar's Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control, General Khin yii, stated the drug incineration on 26 June 2004 was the 18th time the regime had incinerated tons of illegal narcotics.
Khin yii stated that 14.45 billion dollars worth of drugs have been destroyed since the drug destroying events began in 1990.
Khin yii stated that opium production and poppy cultivation has declined since 1990 but that methamphetamines are replacing opium as the main choice of traffickers.
Khin yii stated that stimulant tablets are becoming a threat but did not elaborate on the extent of methamphetamine production or trafficking.
The United Nations stated that opium production has declined by 24 percent in Myanmar since 2003.
In March 2004 the United States stated that while Myanmar had reduced poppy cultivation Myanmar remained the world's 2nd ranked supplier of opium from which derivatives such as heroin are made.
Thai government stated in early 2004 that Thai government was considering building a high-security fence along Thailand's border with Myanmar in a bid to stop smugglers trafficking illegal drugs into Thailand.

Nicaragua commemorated the 25th anniversary of the Sandinista revolution.
The Sandinista revolution ended the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza and imposed a Cuban-style leftist regime.
A mass commemorated those who killed during the Sandinista revolution and those killed during the Sandinista war against US-funded contra rebels in the 1980s.
During the mass Ortega crossed himself and asked Obando to forgive him.
Obando stated that the pardon that has been offered and accepted is an indispensable premise of a stable and durable peace.
The Sandinistas have been accused of persecuting Catholic priests during the 1979-1990 Sandinista rule.
The Sandinistas accused the Church of anti-government activities.
The Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) is currently Nicaragua's primary political opposition group.
The Sandinista group is named after Agusto Cesar Sandino.

Malaysia has agreed in principle to purchase medium-range missiles from China.
China will transfer technology related to very short-range air defense to Malaysia in return.
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak said 040720 that Malaysia has agreed in principle to purchase medium-range missiles from China.
The Bernama news agency said that under the pact between China National precision Machinery Import and Export Corp. and two local companies, cnpmiec would transfer technology on production of the FN-6 shoulder-launched missiles if Malaysia purchases cnpmiec's medium-range ks-1 A missiles.
Included were provisions for special test facilities, tools, manufacturing process documentation, training and technical support.
Razak said after signing a memorandum of understanding on the purchase that if the Malaysian government gives its full commitment, details of the procurement and offset program will be finalized later.
Razak was quoted by Bernama as saying that the procurement of the surface-to-air missiles was part of the Malaysian Armed Forces modernization program and would be made under the 9th Malaysian plan from 060000-090000.
The cost of the weapons were not revealed.
Cnpmiec President Wang bingyan said China had also offered to conclude the ks-1 A transaction on flexible payment terms, including counter-trade, barter and deferred payments.
Bernama said Malaysia had procured very short-range air defense systems from Russia, Pakistan and Britain under the 8th Malaysian plan from 010000-050000.
The Government has dramatically increased major arms procurements in 030000-040000, ranging from Russian Sukhoi fighter jets and British missile systems to French submarines and Polish attack tanks.
The Government of Malaysia has denied the weapons build-up could spark an arms race in the region and says the purchases are simply designed to upgrade defenses and that there are no aggressive intentions.

Pakistan approves installation of second nuclear power plant to be supplied by long-time ally and defense supplier China.
The plant will be constructed next to an existing plant and is projected to be operational in 7 years.
Prime Minister-in-waiting Shaukat Aziz stated 28 July 2004 that Pakistan's top economic body approved the installation of a second nuclear power plant to be supplied by China.
Finance Minister Aziz stated on national television that the National Economic Council has approved phase 2 of the Chashma nuclear power project to cost approximately 51 billion rupees (880 million U.S. dollars).
The plant will generate 300 megawatts of electricity.
A statement issued by the Executive Committee on the National Economic Council said --
It had approved installation of a nuclear power plant approximately 174 miles south of Islamabad at Chashma, Mianwali.
The project comprises a nuclear steam supply system, a turbine generator set and auxiliary equipment including electrical, mechanical and civil work.
The project anticipates technology transfer with the ultimate goal that the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission would be self-sufficient in all aspects of designing, installation, construction and operation.
The plant will be constructed next to an existing plant also supplied by China and operational since 1999.
The second plant will be ready to generate electricity in 7 years.
The agreement to install the plant was signed in May 2004 by China National Nuclear Corporation President Kang Rixin and Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission Chairman Pervez Butt in Islamabad.
Pakistan has relied heavily on long-time friend and ally China for its defense needs since 1990 when the United States stopped supplying it with military hardware because of its nuclear program.
Pakistan confirmed it had nuclear weapons in May 1998 when it matched tests conducted by India.

Chinese hackers are suspected of attempting to hack the website of Japanese war shrine Yasukuni Shrine.
This hacking attempt has coincided with the Asian Cup final, which leads some analysts to believe that the suspected attacks are run-up to the football final between Japan and China.
The website of a controversial war shrine in Toyko called Yasukuni Shrine experienced many abnormal visits from abroad on August 7, 2004.
The abnormal visits caused the website to have browsing problems.
At one point more than 30000 visits to the Yasukuni Shrine website were made at the same time.
The homepage of the website of Yasukuni Shrine was not damaged by the hacking attempts.
No official was immediately available from Yasukuni Shrine to confirm the reports.
Yasukuni Shrine and Japanese government offices may have come under cyber attack from Chinese hackers in the run-up to the Asian Cup football final between Japan and China in Beijing on August 7, 2004.
The suspected cyber attacks on Yasukuni Shrine's website coincided with rowdy behavior by Chinese fans who have repeatedly booed the Japanese football team and anthem as the Japanese football team entered the Asian Cup final against the host China.
A pro-Beijing newspaper in Hong Kong stated that Chinese hackers were mobilizing 1900 people to wage cyber attacks on more than 200 official websites in Japan and Taiwan from August 1, 2004 until August 8, 2004.
The Wen Wei Po stated on August 6, 2004 that the Chinese hackers were thought to have been organized by the China Federation of defending the Diaoyu Islands.
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and his predecessors have angered Asian neighbors who suffered under Japanese occupation by making pilgrimages to Yasukuni Shrine.
China, Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Korea were especially angered.
Yasukuni Shrine is widely seen in Asia as a symbol of Japan's militarism.
Yasukuni Shrine honors the Japanese who died in wars, including the World War II leaders hanged by the US led allies as war criminals.
The Diaoyu Islands are a group of East China Sea islets claimed by Japan, China and Taiwan.

Taiwan's promos dismissed reports that its technology transfer agreement with South Korea's Hynix might falter due to concern from South Korean government over helping foreign competitors.
The companies have exchanged information and established a long-term strategic alliance to share technology.
Taiwan's Promos Technologies Inc. dismissed reports 04 November 2004 that its technology transfer agreement with South Korea's Hynix Semiconductor Inc. might falter due to concern from the Government of South Korea.
A promos official stated to AFP --
Reports that the South Korean government is concerned that Hynix would be helping foreign competitors by establishing a partnership with promos are not true.
The pending agreement is unaffected.
Promos will adopt Hynix's 90 nanometer technology at its new plant in central Taiwan starting in fourth quarter 2005.
Both makers of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips have exchanged information on Hynix's 90 and 70 nanometer technologies.
The company Promos stated that it has passed on to Hynix its expertise in 12-inch (300 millimeter) production.
The 2 DRAM makers signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) in 2003 to initiate a long-term strategic alliance in technology licensing, foundry services and development of new generation memory production processes.
Hynix stated that the new alliance would represent nearly one quarter of the world's DRAM output.
The MOU states that Hynix will license to promos certain proprietary technology for DRAM stack processes while promos offers Hynix its 12-inch fabrication capacity.

Afghanistan's new special narcotics force seized and destroyed more than four tons of drugs, seized equipment and weapons, and detained 10 people in a major operation in southern Helmand province.
The Afghanistan Interior Ministry made a statement 050222 that approximately 47 kilograms (103 pounds) of brown heroin, 830 kilograms of opium, 3.5 tons of hashish and an opium press had been destroyed by the special Narcotics Force.
The statement also said the special Narcotics Force also seized 47 weapons and detained 10 people in Helmand province.
No further details were given and the ministry did not say whether the 10 people arrested were traffickers or ordinary farmers who were growing the narcotics.
Afghanistan's special Narcotics Force was launched 040000 after being trained by British commandos.
Afghanistan is now the leading producer of opium and grows 87 percent of the world's supply of the narcotic according to UN figures.
Afghanistan had a 64 percent increase in opium production in 040000 and has also become a base for heroin refining over 040000.
The Afghan government is receiving support by the international community in taking a harder line on the issue.
President Hamid Karzai declared a holy war on drugs shortly after being elected president in 041000
The US has pledged $780 million to battle Afghanistan's burgeoning drug industry.

Cyber attacks target Japanese Foreign Ministry homepage.
A Japanese official blames South Korean hackers for the attacks, citing the passage of a Japanese resolution that stressed the Japanese government's claim to an island chain controlled by South Korea.
A massive amount of information flooded the homepage of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, www.mofa.go.jp, beginning at 9:50 am (0050 GMT) on 17 March 2005.
Access to the website has been erratic.
Japanese foreign press secretary Hatsuhisa Takashima termed the flood of information a cyber attack and stated that officials are working to fix the problem.
Kyodo News cited a Japanese government source and stated the latest attack may have come from South Korea.
On 16 March 2005 a Japanese local assembly passed a resolution stressing the Japanese government's claim to a small island chain controlled by South Korea.
Anti-Japanese protests occurred in Seoul after the passage of the resolution.
Japanese government websites have come under occasional cyber attacks especially from countries which Japan invaded in the first half of the 20th century.
In January 2005, administrators of the Yasukuni Shrine dedicated to Japan's war dead stated the Yasukuni Shrine's website had been the target of Internet attacks.
Most of these attacks were via e-mails written in Chinese.
In 2000, hackers accessed Japanese government websites and left messages in Chinese and English ranging from insults to attacks on Japan's wartime past, after Japanese conservative groups held a forum in the western city of Osaka to deny the 1937 massacre in the Chinese city of Nanjing by Japanese troops.

Taiwan's chip company United Microelectronics Corp (UMC) announced on March 21, 2005 that it would obtain a 15 percent stake in China-based chipmaker hejian technology through a compensation package.
Taiwan's chip company United Microelectronics Corp (UMC) announced on March 21, 2005 that it would obtain a 15 percent stake in China-based chipmaker hejian technology through a compensation package.
The stake was valued at 3.5 billion Taiwan dollars (110 million US dollars) and the investment goes to the core of cross-Straits investment ties.
Both companies are being investigated in Taiwan for alleged breach of trust.
UMC Chairman Robert Tsao said the company had submitted a letter to Taiwan's Investment Commission asking for assistance in transferring the stake.
It said it was compensation for previous assistance.
UMC manufactures cutting-edge microchips.
The chips are installed in a wide range of computers and electronics found in mobile phones, televisions and cars.
The technology is highly prized in Taiwan.
Market analysts believe the assistance involved a technology transfer from UMC to hejian and the compensation through the stake represents a payment.
No cash changed hands.
Tsao said the letter followed a verbal promise made by hejian technology to pay UMC a reasonable amount of compensation.
That included a commitment to merge the two companies.
Tsao said no formal written agreements had been signed.
Both companies would next seek a strategic partnership if the Investment Commission approved the deal.
UMC is the world's second largest wafer foundry and has recognized its investment in hejian which had previously been denied.
Taiwan authorities lifted a ban in March 2002 on mainland-bound investment in eight-inch (200 millimeter) silicon wafer plants.
This followed assurances from potential investors that the island would not lose out on transferred technology.
Prosecutors raided the homes and offices of UMC executives in February 2005 as part of a probe into the alleged illegal supply of funds, technology and human resources to hejian.
Hejian was founded in November 2001 with capital of 350 million U.S. dollars.
Its Chairman Hsu Chien-hua has been barred from leaving Taiwan after being bailed out of police custody for 10 million Taiwan dollars.
Tsao and UMC vice chairman John hsuan have also been named as defendants in on-going investigations.
UMC has never sought government approval for China-bound investments.
The company has previously called hejian technology a friendly company while denying any financial ties between the two.
Only UMC peer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. has received official approval to build a plant in Shanghai.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is the world's biggest contract microchip-maker.

India is expected to close a $2 billion dollar deal to buy 6 French Scorpene submarines in a few days.
This deal has been in process for several years and will strengthen India's military capability.
Vice-Chief of Naval Staff Yashwant Prasad in India stated March 22, 2005 that India will close a $2 billion dollar deal under which the Indian Navy will buy 6 French Scorpene submarines in a few days.
The deal has been in process for several years.
The deal will also include a technology transfer that will allow the Scorpene submarines to be manufactured under license in India at the mazagaon docks off the western city of Bombay.
The goal of the submarine deal is to strengthen a weakness in India's conventional military capability.
A source in the Prime Minister's office stated that the deal was on the agenda of the next security cabinet meeting on March 29, 2005.
A naval official stated that the final approval for the project was discussed when French Chief of Defense Staff General Henri Bentegeat visited India in February, 2005.
A naval official stated that once the deal is approved the first submarine will not be ready for induction for at least 6 years.
The naval official also stated that by the time the first submarine is ready for induction some of the older boats in India's fleet of 16 diesel-electric submarines will be ready for decommission.

Mekong countries meet in Cambodia to pledge new anti-drug commitment and revisit 1993 anti-drug pact
20050519 ministers and officials from countries surrounding the Mekong River (Cambodia, China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam) met to discuss the progress of a 1993 pact aimed at stemming illicit drugs in the sixth semiannual Ministerial Meeting in Siem Reap, northwestern Cambodia.
The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) stated that the countries adopted the Siem Reap Declaration as a renewed commitment to act against the region's expanding drug trade.
The countries discussed exchanging information, controlling chemicals needed to make illicit drugs, controlling amphetamines, providing drug treatment and sustainable alternative development.
5 projects worth 10.6 million dollars are currently in operation under an action plan implemented as part of the 1993 pact with UNDOC.
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen opened the meeting and stated --
Regional cross-border crime flourishes due to increasingly open borders and more amicable economic and social relations among countries in the region.
Producing and trafficking illegal drugs is only 1 aspect of organized transnational crime.
Money Laundering is a particular concern for the Mekong Sub-region because this money will fund terrorist activities.
Cambodia is considered an increasingly important trans-shipment point for illicit drugs in the region.
Myanmar is the 2nd largest opium producer globally and the United States has criticized Myanmar for failing to meet international anti-drug commitments.
Siem Reap is the gateway town to the Angkor Wat temple complex.

Experts warn of new cyber attack encrypting documents and extorting payment for decryption.
1 case reported with potentially many in future.
Software protection companies warn of a new form of cyper-attack called ransomware.
If it installs successfully, ransomware encrypts text files and displays a ransom note demanding 200 dollars to supply decryption software to restore the data to its original form.
20050601 anti-virus program manufacturer Symantec stated on its website (http://www.Symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/Trojan.pgpcoder.html) that the attacking program is a Trojan horse.
Trojan horses do not replicate from machine to machine as viruses do.
Symantec stated that the ransomware enters the computer via weaknesses in the victim's Web browser and then scans the hard drive and encrypts any text-based documents found.
20050604 the British weekly New Scientist stated that 1 case of ransomware has been discovered which may pioneer a new and dangerous generation of malicious software.
The known ransomware program is titled pgpcoder in an attempt to undermine the legal, popular and highly secure encryption product pretty good privacy.
New Scientist stated that the California web-filtering company websense discovered pgpcoder and notified the FBI.
Pgpcoder used an unsophisticated algorithm to encrypt the data so that a computer consultant was able to decode the documents easily.
New Scientist stated that future virus writers may compel victims to pay by encrypting files using military-grade systems.
Ransomware's weakness is that the demand includes a traceable contact email address and electronic bank account.

On June 3, 2005 Israeli military officials stated in the New York Times that Syria test fired three Scud missiles a week ago in an act of defiance to the United States and the United Nations.
One of the missiles broke up over two Turkish villages.
It caused no injuries.
The officials stated the missile tests were normal.
It was Syria's first since 2001 and caused embarrassment to Turkey.
Syria decided to make the missile tests public because the U.S. silence about them was unsettling.
The Israeli officials in Tel Aviv told the daily that the missile tests were part of a Syrian missile development project using North Korean technology.
The three missiles were the older Scud B that has a range of 300 kilometers (185 miles) and two Scud D's with a range of 700 kilometers (435 miles).
The missiles are designed to deliver air-burst chemical weapons.
The official said the launchings on May 27, 2003 were Syrian President Bashir al-Assad's response to U.S. and UN pressures that forced al-Assad to withdraw Syrian troops from neighboring Lebanon.
This was in the wake of the February assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Harari.
A senior Israeli military official said the tests are probably needed for the missile project but Bashir is taking a risk and sending a message.
Anti-Syrian journalist Samir kassir was killed June 2, 2005 when a bomb exploded under kassir's car in Beirut.
The attack is blamed on the pro-Syrian regime and widely condemned at home and abroad.
Syria angrily denied the accusations through its official news agency, SANA.
The Israeli officials said the Syrian missiles were launched from northern Syria Newar minakh.
One was sent about 400 kilometers (250 miles) to southernmost Syria near the Jordanian border.
The missile that that broke up was launched southwest toward the Mediterranean, over the Turkish province of Hatay and shed debris over two villages there.
The Israelis said they had film of the launching and breakup.
The Turkish Ambassador to the United States Osman Faruk Logoglu told The New York Times there were no casualties in the missile breakup.
Osman Faruk Logoglu added that Syria had apologized for the technical mishap.

Taiwan successfully fired its first cruise missile.
This will enable Taiwan to hit major military targets in southeast China.
050605 the China Times reported that Taiwan has successfully test fired the Hsiung Feng its first cruise missile enabling Taiwan to hit major military targets in southeast China.
The China Times stated that the Hsiung Feng cruise missile was developed by the military-run chungshan Institute of Science and Technology, has a range of 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) and could be used to attack military bases in southeast China.
The China Times stated that once the missile was deployed it would mark the first time that Taiwan is able to put strategic weapons into use and that the political and military impact of this would be far-reaching.
The Times said Defense Minister Lee jye witnessed the test firing of the missile from chiupeng military base in the southern Pingtung County and that the missile flew over 500 kilometers (300 miles) before hitting its target.
The defense ministry declined to comment on the report.
The report did not specify when the test took place but speculated that it could have been in March.
The missile is expected to go into pilot production later in 050000 or 060000.
Taiwan is striving to build up its missile defense capabilities to counter the military threat from China.
Officials state that China has targeted Taiwan with approximately 700 ballistic missiles.
Taiwan's cabinet approved a revised arms deal with the United States in 050500 worth almost 15.5 billion dollars after a previous proposal was rejected by parliament.
The arms package over a 15-year period beginning in 050000 includes 8 conventional submarines, a modified version of the Patriot anti-missile system and a fleet of anti-submarine aircraft.
The package is pending final approval by Parliament.
This large budget proposal has provoked debate Taiwan as critics said the spending could further provoke China and heighten cross-strait tensions.
China considers Taiwan part of its territory awaiting reunification since they split at the end of the civil war in 490000, and has repeatedly threatened to invade if Taiwan moves towards formal independence.

Brazilian government and Abbott Laboratories agree on lower price for AIDS drug Kaletra in response to Brazilian threat to violate the patent.
According to WHO studies the price of the drug was exorbitant and the Brazilian government demanded that Abbot lower the price.
On 08 July 2005 Brazil's Ministry of Health stated that U.S. company Abbott Laboratories has agreed to reduce the price of its HIV/AIDS drug Kaletra to prevent Brazil from violating the company's patent as it had threatened.
The ministry said in a statement --
The agreement made with Abbott guarantees the Ministry's proposed objectives ensuring a significant price cut for the drug over the next 6 years.
Abbott agreed to a technology transfer procedure so that Brazil's state-run farmanguinhos laboratories can begin producing Kaletra in 2009.
The agreement guarantees access to Meltrex by Brazilian patients.
Meltrex is an updated version of Kaletra that is pending approval by U.S. health authorities.
Over the 6 years which the Agreement covers Brazil expects to save up to 259 million U.S. dollars in drug purchases.
The Ministry recently stated that an agreement with Abbott would save Brazil 18 million U.S. dollars in its 2006 budget to provide AIDS patients free anti-AIDS treatment consisting of a cocktail of anti-retroviral drugs including Kaletra.
Currently 24000 patients in Brazil receive Kaletra.
The number is expected to increase to 60000 by 2011.
On 24 June 2005 Brazil declared Kaletra a drug of national interest and demanded that Abbott decide within 10 days to either agree to lower its price for the drug or face a violation of its patent.
On 24 June 2005 Brazilian Health Minister Humberto Costa stated that the price paid by the Brazilian Government to purchase Kaletra represented a yearly cost of 2630 U.S. dollars per patient.
Costa stated that this price is considered exorbitant because studies of the World Health Organization (WTO) showed that for large-scale production the fair price including a considerable margin of profit should range from 480 to 540 U.S. dollars per patient per year.
Costa stated that Brazil planned to have a less expensive generic copy of the patented drug produced locally by a state-owned company.
Illinois-based Abbott stated that Brazil's demands were illegal and warned that developing unproven alternative HIV medication posed significant consequences for patients.
Abbott stated that it remained open to an agreeable solution.

Pakistani analysts say that Pakistan's network of madrassas has close links with Islamic extremists in Britain, who supply them with extremist recruits and funding.
Pakistani analysts said on 050715 that Pakistan's network of madrassa Islamic schools has close links with Islamic extremists in Britain, who supply them with extremist recruits and vital funding.
On 050714 British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw expressed concern over what goes on in some Pakistani madrassas.
It has emerged that Shehzad Tanweer was one of the terrorists who carried out the bombing of an underground subway train at Aldgate in east London.
Tanweer was said by his uncle to have gone in 041200 to a Pakistani madrassa, wanting to learn to recite the Koran by heart.
Sources in Pakistan said that British authorities should look inside British borders where the South Asian community is turning to increasingly extremist religious views.
Kamila hyat of Pakistan's Human Rights Commision said that militancy is being exported in the reverse direction.
Younger Pakistanis coming from Britain have very extreme and hard-line views and view British culture as decadent.
When Pakistani-British youngsters come to Pakistan they are surprised to see women walking around without burqas.
Analysts say Tanweer's trip to Pakistan was by no means unusual, as many Pakistani families who emigrated some 40 or 50 years ago and settled in Britain send their children for religious teaching at madrassas.
Hyat said they want to ensure their children are not alienated from their family faith and hope a brief stint of a few terms will help ground them in Islamic and Pakistani culture.
Hyat said that complaints have nonetheless been received from parents in Pakistan who are very concerned about teenagers who graduate and then go back to the UK for University.
The parents of some madrassa students are saying that the young men are somewhat confused when away from the UK for the first time and are consistently being approached by other Pakistanis or by Arabs who attempt to get them to join extremist groups.
Such students bring extremism back to the UK when coming back home.
Madrassas continue to produce a peculiar state of mind in students, said Hasan Askari.
Askari is the former head of political science department at Lahore's Punjab University.
Askari said that these students having a state of mind of religious orthodoxy are vulnerable to violence and extremism.
Some of the radical religious schools in Pakistan have thrived on funds regularly coming from supporters among the Muslim community in Britain.
Security sources say that in one case, several thousand pounds were sent to outlawed Sipah-e-Sahaba of Pakistan in 030000.
Pakistani security officials informed the British authorities and identified the man who sent the money as Mullah Hamid.
Mullah Hamid was a prayer leader in a mosque in Glasgow.
Pakistan admits that some of the estimated 10,000 madrassas in Pakistan are breeding grounds for extremism.
Madrassas have been a part of Muslim social life on the Indian subcontinent for decades.
In the 1980s they became a recruiting ground for the US-sponsored militant movement against the Soviet occupation of neighboring Afghanistan.
President Pervez Musharraf has been campaigning since early 030000 for reform of madrassas.
Many madrassas are unregulated and the International Crisis Group says 1.5 million students attend such Islamic schools.
Education Minister Javed Ashraf stated on 050715 that efforts were working to get madrassa leaders to broaden the curriculum beyond rote Koranic learning and to encompass useful and employable skills.

20050705 terrorist attacks may prompt counter-extremism measures sufficient to force Islamist militant organizations in London into convert operations via the Internet.
Anti-terrorist laws in the UK strengthened and suspected extremists were pursued more aggressively after the 20010911 attacks in the US.
The 20050707 terrorist attacks that killed 56 on London underground trains and a double-decker bus prompted demands for further anti-terror laws and surveillance of Islamist militants.
Director of the Center for the Study of terrorism at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland Magnus ranstorp stated that the militants may be forced underground into the cybersphere, which has potential utility for command, communication, and especially recruitment.
Londonistan is the Islamist core operating in London.
The two main components of londonistan are the international Jihad Movement and the exiled opposition to current Arab or Muslim regimes.
Londonistan emerged in the 1990s because London was a center for finance and Arabic media and because of Britain's lenient asylum laws.
20050718 the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House) stated --
By the mid-1990s British intelligence agencies and police were aware that London was expanding as a base for promoters, funders, and planners of terrorism in the Middle East and elsewhere.
Officials did not perceive any threat to national security and the individuals continued their activities with relative impunity.
Ranstorm stated that the militants have previously cautiously avoided incitement to violence.
Foreign Governments opposed the British government's passive policy.
Government crackdown --
In 2004 British authorities dismantled the Finsbury Park mosque in London, the previous venue of Salafist jihadists.
Since then the militants have moved to informal areas, study groups, and youth centers.
The former imam of Finsbury Park mosque is Egyptian-born Abu Hamza al-Masri.
Masri is crippled with 1 eye and 1 arm and is incarcerated in Belmarsh prison awaiting a 20060100 trial on charges of inciting racial hatred and murder.
Abu Qatada is a Palestinian considered the spiritual chief for Al-Qaeda in Europe.
He is under house arrest after serving 2.5 years at Belmarsh.
French researcher Dominique Thomas stated --
The remaining preachers must adopt a clandestine attitude or risk surveillance or arrest.
Islamist groups such as those seeking reform in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, or Libya will be stymied.
Londonistan's imminent disappearance may force militants to seek a clandestine meeting place on the Internet.
There are a number of websites managed or administered from London and the Internet facilitates global connection.

China's research and development spending will catch up with that of the EU in 090000 or 100000 if current spending trends continue.
Conditions for research and development in some emerging markets like China may be surpassing Europe's, so European companies are transferring some of their investments there.
The Financial Times reported 051010 that in just 5 years China will be spending proportionally more on research and development than the European Union.
EU Commissioner for research Janez Potocnik told the Financial Times that the Chinese trend is extremely clear.
Potocnik said that China will catch up with the EU in 090000 or 100000 if the trend continues.
The Financial Times said research and development investment in China was 1.31 percent of GDP in 030000 but is rising at a double-digit rate.
The Financial Times said that at present growth rates, the EU's public and private spending on research and development is set to rise from 1.93 percent of gross domestic product in 030000 to 2.2 percent in 100000.
This is well short of the 3 percent target agreed by EU heads of government as part of the 020000 Lisbon Strategy.
Potocnik was quoted as saying that the conditions for research and development in some emerging markets like China are improving and it is obvious that European companies are transferring some of their investments there.
Potocnik is worried about Europe's unfavorable research and development environment ranging from excessive red tape to insufficient corporate tax incentives and continued divergences in intellectual property protection and patenting.
In response to the research and development boom in countries such as China and India, the EU government will this week table new proposals to help retain and attract research funding in the EU.
An EU government plan to double the EU's own research and development budget to 70 billion euro over 060000-110000 was shelved in June amid a dispute among EU leaders over future EU funding.

Deadly attacks in India continue despite deaths of Pakistani Kashmir rebels and destruction of group infrastructure due to earthquake.
There is conflicting opinion as to the extent of damage suffered by the insurgency.
Rebel fighting continues despite losses suffered by Islamic rebels in Pakistan-ruled Kashmir in the massive earthquake.
The Indian government is attempting to assess the extent of losses suffered by rebels.
Police stated that on 18 October 2005 2 militants entered the fortified Srinagar home of junior Education Minister Ghulam Nabi lone of the People's Democratic Party (PDF) and shot him to death.
2 policemen and 1 of the attackers also died and 5 others were injured in the gunfight.
The attack occurred less than 1 day after suspected rebels shot and killed a prominent communist politician in Indian Kashmir.
The daily violence has continued despite a ceasefire declaration in areas affected by the 08 October 2005 earthquake.
The violence that has occurred since the earthquake has been attributed to an umbrella group of separatists called the United Jihad Council.
Some insurgents have joined relief efforts.
The Indian military has not reacted to insurgents' relief efforts and has continued counter-insurgency operations.
The army states that while it directs aid work it has also killed more than 30 militants since the earthquake.
Federal Intelligence agencies have been working to assess the damage to insurgents in and around Muzaffarabad.
Muzaffarabad is the militants' headquarters and the capital of Pakistani Kashmir.
Army chief General J. J. Singh stated --
The epicenter of the 7.6-magnitude earthquake was in Muzaffarabad and caused damage among the militant groups.
All the terrorist infrastructure in and around Muzaffarabad was destroyed and many innocent people died.
It is premature to state with certainty what impact the earthquake has had on the militant groups as infrastructure remains intact in other areas in Pakistan.
The militant groups are seeking either independence for Kashmir or absorption into Pakistan.
Over 1300 people in Indian Kashmir and 41000 people in Pakistan were killed in the earthquake.
The Indian government accuses the Pakistani government of training, arming and funding the Islamic rebellion.
The Pakistani government denies this charge but states that it does extend moral, political and diplomatic support to Kashmiri separatists.
Head of military operations in Indian Kashmir Brigadier Madan Gopal expressed confidence on 17 October 2005 that many of the militants had been killed.
Gopal stated that the Hizbul Mujahedin and the Lashkar-e-Toiba have suffered major losses in the earthquake on the Pakistani side.
Hizbul Mujahedin and Lashkar-e-Toiba are groups that carry out frequent attacks.
Violence continues despite conflicting opinion on the extent of damage suffered by the rebel groups.
Retired General V. N. Sharma rejects suggestions that the earthquake has critically damaged the core of the insurgency.
Sharma was India's army chief when the insurgency erupted in 1989.
Sharma states that such suggestions are unrealistic.
Sharma states that he does not think the insurgency has been destroyed because the groups are mobile units and live in tented accommodations.
Sharma states that the destruction of a few communications centers or sub-command posts has little affect on the Greater organization.
Approximately 44000 people have died in the insurgency.
Head of the Military-funded Institute of Defense studies and analysis in New Delhi Uday Bhaskar also warned against complacency stating that loss of firepower and manpower is unimportant.
Bhaskar stated that the militants will soon regroup because they are highly motivated and believe they can achieve their goal of freeing Kashmir from Indian control with violence.
The Indian government is also taking a cautious approach.
Indian Defense Minister Pranab Mukherjee on 17 October 2005 called for vigilance along the 430-mile de facto border which divides the two Kashmirs.
Mukherjee stated --
Militants have attempted to infiltrate Indian Kashmir approximately 5 times since 08 October 2005 including twice on a single day.
Some of the militants wanted to take advantage of the unstable situation in the region.
The presence of civilians among the troops on relief work could help militants cross the de facto border.
There could be more infiltration attempts next week before winter snow blocks the mountain passes.

During a 4-day tour of France Chinese Prime Minister Wen states that French company Areva must improve its offer for a nuclear reactor deal with regard to price and technology transfer.
Wen also signed a deal to initiate student exchange programs and attempted to allay anxiety about China's rapidly growing power.
On 06 December 2005 Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao stated that in order to win a contract to build third-generation nuclear reactors in China France must improve its offer in terms of both cost and transfers of technology.
Wen was speaking on the 3rd day of a 4-day visit to France.
On a tour of the elite Polytechnique Science University in the southern suburbs of Paris Wen stated that China hopes France will offer more attractive conditions on technology transfer as well as price so that Franco-Chinese cooperation in this field can develop.
The French company Areva is bidding for an 8 billion U.S. dollar (6.8 billion euro) deal to construct 4 reactors in China as are U.S. company Westinghouse and Russian company atomstroyexport.
The bidding among the 3 companies has been competitive.
China was to have announced a winner by the end of 2005 but has delayed its decision until early next year hoping to elicit better terms from the bidders.
On 05 December 2005 during the 4-day visit to France a Chinese order for 150 medium-range A320 airliners from the European consortium Airbus was announced.
Airbus also signed a protocol that could lead to aircraft being constructed in China.
Prime Minister Wen held talks in Paris with French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin and French President Jacques Chirac and was then to depart the afternoon of 06 December 2005 to Marseille to visit the headquarters of the helicopter manufacturer Eurocopter.
On 05 December 2005 Eurocopter announced a 600 million Euro partnership deal with China to share development and production of a new 16-seat aircraft called the ec175.
Wen is scheduled to visit the site of the future experimental nuclear fusion reactor ITER in which China is a partner.
On 07 December 2005 Wen is scheduled to tour the space-satellite facility of telecommunications company Alcatel in Cannes.
Wen departs on 07 December 2005 for Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Portugal.
1 of the reasons for Wen's visit to the 200 year-old Polytechnique at palaiseau was to sign a partnership deal with three Chinese universities that will introduce new exchange programs and shared qualifications.
Wen stated --
The dynamic young students represented the future of the world.
Student exchanges are more important than the purchase of 150 Airbus.
At present there is economic cooperation between China and France but with such programs in the future there will be cultural cooperation.
In a speech to students, professors and business leaders, Wen attempted to allay anxiety in Europe that China's fast-growing economic power is a threat to the rest of the world.
Wen stated that because China suffered so much from foreign invasions it understands the value of peace.
Wen stated that for China to choose peace is logical given its history and culture.
China's development is not a threat but an opportunity for the world.
The French have expressed fear that China's low costs and poor standards of social security are attracting economic activity and causing increased unemployment in Europe but Wen argued that growing domestic demand in China will eventually lead to new opportunities for foreign exporters.
France views China as a strategic ally in its pursuit of a multipolar world that is not dominated by the U.S. though trade relations between France and China remain low.
France ranks 15th among suppliers to China providing only 1.4 percent of China's foreign needs.

UN undersecretary-general for disarmament affairs WARNS AGAINST increases in global military spending, citing arms sales to developing countries and failures in nuclear disarmament negotiations.
20010830 UN undersecretary-general for Disarmament Affairs Jayantha Dhanapala stated in a speech at Macquarie University in Sydney issued by his office at the UN that global military spending is rising at an alarming rate after years of decline following the 1991 end of the cold war.
20010600 the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute reported that global military spending increased from 780 billion dollars in 1999 to 798 billion dollars in 2000.
Developing countries -- Dhanapala stated that as before military spending increased at the highest rates in African and South Asian countries with significant unmet social and economic needs.
Dhanapala stated that arms sales to developing countries increased 8 percent to over 36 billion dollars in 2000.
The Stockholm Institute stated that 23 of 25 major armed conflicts in the world in 2000 occurred in impoverished nations.
Dhanapala stated that impoverished countries involved in armed conflicts wasted human lives and scarce economic resources.
Dhanapala called the situation tragic and noted that half of the world's population lives on under 2 dollars per day.
20010800 the US Congressional Research Service reported that the US sold almost 50 percent of weapons purchased by developing countries in 2000, followed by Russia, France, Germany, Britain and China.
The United Arab Emirates, India, and South Korea lead weapons purchases in 2000.
Dhanapala stated that the United Arab Emirates, India, and South Korea are the world's three most volatile regions.
Dhanapala stated that the first resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1946 called for the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction.
20010830 the UN Security Council passed a resolution for armed conflict prevention requesting that Member States ensure implementation of the UN program of action on the illicit trade in small arms developed in a summit on small arms in New York in 20010700.
Dhanapala stated --
Approximately 30000 nuclear weapons remain in arsenals around the world and many are on high alert.
Approximately 550 million small arms remain in circulation around the world.
The numbers of both large and small weapons are alarming.
Dhanapala stated that international efforts to halt or decelerate the spread of weapons have stalled.
Dhanapala stated that negotiations on nuclear disarmament and controlling the fissile material used in nuclear weapons are deadlocked at the UN Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.
The nuclear test ban treaty has not received sufficient ratifications to enter into force.
20010700 efforts to enforce a ban on biological warfare failed when the US declared a draft proposal unacceptable.
Dhanapala stated that the stated intention of the US to withdraw as a party jeopardizes the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty may incite a new phase of the global nuclear arms race as well the probability of a missile race and the weaponization of space.
US President George W. Bush has announced plans for the construction of an anti-missile shield, which would violate the 1972 ABM Treaty that Russia considers to be a cornerstone of international security.

The Japanese government said on January 11, 2002 that it had clamped down on the financial transactions of three more suspected terrorist groups as part of its efforts to freeze assets used to fund terrorism.
A statement issued jointly by Japan's foreign, finance and economy ministries said authorities have imposed controls on transactions involving Hamas-Izz al-Din al-Qassem, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba.
Hamas-Izz al-Din al-Qassem and Palestinian Islamic Jihad are fighting to end the Israeli occupation of Palestine.
Lashkar-e-Tayyiba is engaged in a guerrilla war with Indian security forces to create an independent Islamic state in the disputed territory of Kashmir.
The statement said Japan has restricted the transactions of a total of 12 organizations and individuals suspected of terrorist activities.
Another 293 are believed to have ties to Afghanistan's Taliban militia.
The Taliban are accused of sheltering Osama bin Laden.
The United States has named bin Laden as the mastermind of the September 11 terrorist attacks on Washington and New York.
The Japanese government announced in October 2001 that Japan had frozen three Taliban bank accounts in Japan holding about dlrs 600,000.
Another 28 accounts amounting to about 18 million yen (about dlrs 136,000) were frozen because they were suspected of being connected to the Taliban.

Ret. Lt.-Gen. Anatoly Sokolov announced -- Soviet-built a-135 missile defense system around Moscow is obsolete and inefficient.
He says Russia is not strong enough to modernize the existing antimissile system and should build new missile defense technologies instead.
15 April 2002 retired Russian Space Forces General Ret. Lt.-Gen. Anatoly Sokolov announced --
Soviet-built a-135 missile defense system around Moscow is obsolete and inefficient.
The A-135 system is the only such system in the world.
The A-135 system should be removed.
The A-135 system is unable to provide protection of the area or the country.
USSR deployed a-35 anti-ballistic missile system in 1974.
The A-35 --
was deployed around Moscow.
consisted of radars and 64 missile interceptors.
was continually modified with independently-targeted multiple warheads.
A-135 launched in 1994 as latest version of A-35.
A-135 includes long- and medium-range missile interceptors.
The Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty allows the US and Russia to protect a single site with no more than 100 interceptors.
Russia's missile defense system complied with the ABM Treaty.
In 1970s the US had a similar system to protect missile fields in North Dakota.
The US has destroyed this system.
The ABM Treaty bars a nationwide missile shield of the kind the US wants to deploy.
In December 2001 President George W. Bush warned Russia that the US would withdraw from the ABM Treaty in 6 months.
Russian President Vladimir Putin stated --
US withdrawal from the ABM Treaty was not a threat to Russian security.
US withdrawal from the ABM would hurt global stability.
Russian officials have said recently that the Moscow missile defense system could be upgraded in the next few years,
Sokolov stated --
Russian government should not modernize the old missile defense system but build new missile defense technologies instead.
Modernization would be costly.
Russia is not strong enough to modernize the existing antimissile system.
Russia has lost several Soviet-built long-range radars essential for effective operation of an anti-missile system.
A new anti-missile system in Belarus would be inadequate.
Sokolov previously served as a top commander with Russia's space forces.

Malaysia's Deputy Home Affairs Minister Chor Chee Heung calls for leaders of Southeast Asian countries to standardize domestic laws and introduce anti-terrorism laws at a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
Some ASEAN officials stated such standardization would be difficult due to different countries' political systems.
Officials from Singapore and the Philippines requested Indonesian government exert control over Islamic militants in Indonesia, but an Indonesian official denies Indonesia is a base for Southeast Asian terrorists.
On 16 May 2002 Malaysia's Deputy Home Affairs Minister Chor Chee Heung told delegates from the region that leaders of Southeast Asian countries should consider standardizing domestic laws and should introduce new laws to aid the efforts against terrorism and cross-border crime.
Chor made the statement at a meeting of senior police and officials from the law and order ministries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN.
ASEAN members are Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Brunei, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and Myanmar.
The 2-day ASEAN Conference focused on fighting sea piracy, gun smuggling, drug trafficking, illegal immigration and other cross-border crimes.
Chor stated the pace of technological improvements is rapidly outstripping the abilities of law enforcement agencies to keep pace with transnational criminal organizations.
Chor stated the recent communications developments have aided cross-border money laundering, illegal gambling and electronic fraud.
Chor stated that forging extradition treaties, standardizing definitions of crimes, simplifying laws on the seizure of criminal proceeds and introducing similar witness protection programs would be beneficial.
Chor stated harmonization of laws will spread the risks that criminal organizations have to confront and provide fewer safe havens for transnational organized crime organizations.
Some officials stated the task would be difficult for ASEAN members because of varied legal and political systems.
Deputy Commissioner of the Royal Palace Thai police's Special Branch Amarin neemskul stated standardizing laws in Southeast Asia was not currently possible though the willingness is there.
ASEAN officials will hold separate talks on combating terrorism immediately after the Conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
In early May 2002 officials from the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia signed an anti-terrorism agreement to share airline passenger lists and other intelligence.
Thai Government has indicated Thailand will join the pact.
U.S. military trainers are aiding officials in the Philippines in attempting to remove Islamic guerrillas from the southern Philippines.
A number of suspected Islamic militants with alleged al-Qaida links have been arrested in Malaysia and Singapore, and officials stated the militants' network extends into Indonesia.
Officials from ASEAN countries including Singapore and the Philippines have urged Indonesian Government to exercise control over Islamic militant groups in Indonesia.
Indonesia's top police officer assigned to Interpol Dadang Garnida stated to reporters at the ASEAN meeting that no evidence indicated Indonesia was a base for Southeast Asian terrorists and that Islamic extremist groups in Indonesia were legitimate forums for promoting solidarity among Muslims, unless members broke the law.

Home Minister of Malaysia Abdullah Ahmad Badawi told a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations that Southeast Asian countries must work together to stop criminals from abetting terrorist activity.
On 20 May 2002 Home Minister of Malaysia Abdullah Ahmad Badawi told a regional counter-terrorism meeting --
Arms smugglers and drug cartels must be eliminated from Southeast Asia.
Arms smugglers and drug cartels abet terrorists.
Arms smugglers and drug cartels provide militant groups with weapons and funds in return for protection.
The counter-terrorism meeting took place between interior security ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The meetings lasted 2 days.
Badawi is also deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia.
Police and ASEAN interior security ministers will be asked to make their laws covering transnational crime more alike.
At a related meeting last week ASEAN officials named drug trafficking, weapons smuggling, money laundering, sea piracy, illegal immigration and cybercrime as areas where cooperation between countries can strengthen regional defenses.
ASEAN ministers are expected to approve plans to forge extradition treaties, sign bilateral and multilateral agreements on intelligence sharing and harmonize criminal laws.
ASEAN ministers will discuss a proposal for joint training exercises in bomb detection, airport security and intelligence gathering.
In early May 2002 the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia signed an agreement to share terrorism intelligence.
Thailand has stated it will sign the agreement.
ASEAN Deputy Secretary-General Ahmad Mokhtar Selat stated --
Ministers may encourage other nations to sign the agreement.
A trilateral agreement could form a regional agreement encompassing all 10 ASEAN member countries.
The Philippines seeks to eliminate Islamic guerrillas in the restive south.
The Philippines is being assisted by U.S. military trainers.
Suspected Islamic militants with alleged al-Qaida links have been arrested in Malaysia and Singapore.
In 2001 a plot by these militants to bomb Western embassies was exposed.
Some ASEAN countries have stated that a regional Islamic militant network extends into Indonesia.
Abdullah stated that swift action by ASEAN governments had been able to --
identify terrorist threats early
Stop major regional terror networks from proliferating
Abdullah was apparently referencing laws in Malaysia and Singapore that allow for indefinite jailing of suspects with trial.
ASEAN members are Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Brunei, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and Myanmar/ Burma.

Ukraine almost has all of the necessary approvals to join the European Space Agency's program.
Ukraine is considered likely to gain the remaining approvals which will allow Ukraine to join the program and share its renowned space technologies.
The European Space Agency recommended on June 6, 2002 that Ukraine join a multinational program that could greatly expand markets for Ukrainian space technology.
Head of the European Space Agency's technology transfer program Pierre Brisson stated that the European Space Agency will have to ask the European Commission before confirming Ukraine can join the program.
Pierre Brisson also stated that the European Commission will most likely issue approval by August 5, 2002 and work on the project could start on December 5, 2002.
The Ukrainian Government must also approve the Ukraine's participation in the program but Deputy Director of Ukraine's national space agency Eduard Kuznetsov stated that no problems are expected because of President Leonid Kuchma's pro-European goals.
The European Space Agency's endorsement followed Ukraine's formal announcement to bid to join NATO on May 29, 2002.
Pierre Brisson led a team of European experts on a visit to Kiev to discuss commercial applications of Ukrainian space technology with representatives of the National Space Agency of Ukraine, scientists and business leaders.
Pierre Brisson stated that Ukraine's materials and processing sectors are the most immediately promising to other European clients and could have a large impact on the future.
Eduard Kuznetsov stated that the space sector will outperform Ukraine's overall integration schedules because the branch already has a record of international cooperation.
Ukraine is an impoverished former Soviet republic that gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 and has since a space power.
President Leonid Kuchma's goal for Ukraine is greater integration into Europe.
A Ukrainian company built in the Soviet era called yuzmash has helped found the Sea Launch project with the United States, Russia and Norway to launch satellites from converted sea-based oil drilling platforms.
A Ukrainian cosmonaut named loenid Kadenyuk has flown a successful mission on the U.S. space shuttle.
The European Space Agency's program has so far transferred more than 100 technologies.
15 new companies with a turnover of 150 million euros or 140 million dollars and thousands of new jobs were created as a result.
Russia already participates in the European Space Agency's program.

Embraer opened a new factory in the Sao Paulo state of Brazil in order to better compete to win a contract with the Brazilian air force.
Embraer inaugurated a new factory to build corporate jets and expand into the military aviation sector on June 11, 2002.
Mauricio betelho stated that the factory will allow Embraer to enter business sectors it has not yet entered.
The factory is located in an area called gaviao Peixoto in the Sao Paulo state in Brazil.
Gaviao Peixoto is a small orange and sugar cane farming town of 4500 inhabitants about 300 kilometers or 180 miles northwest of Sao Paulo.
This location was called ideal to test military aircraft at supersonic speeds.
Embraer is investing 150 million dollars over 10 years to upgrade the factory's technology so that the factory can produce Embraer's new legacy corporate jet and a range of military aircraft.
The military aircraft include the EMB-145 reconnaissance and alx super Tucano training planes.
The factory contains a 5 kilometer or 3 mile long test runway which is the longest in the southern hemisphere.
Embraer President Mauricio betelho stated that the factory is expected to employ 1000 people by 2003 and 3000 people over the next decade.
The factory is expected to attract investments by the jetmaker's suppliers.
Kawaski heavy industries of Japan is the first supplier to invest in the factory.
This supplier will use the factory to make wings for Embraer's new 08 seat erj 190/195 passenger jets.
Mauricio betelho stated kawaski heavy industries is likely to be just the first of several suppliers to invest in the plant.
Embraer is the world's 4th largest aircraft manufacturer and Brazil's top exporter.
Embraer is 1 of 4 competitors for a contract to supply the Brazilian air force with 12 new supersonic fighters.
Embraer is working with French partner Dassault avaiation to gain technology transfer which should give the local bid an advantage over the other competitiors.
The winner of this contract is expected to be announced in a few days.
If Embraer wins the contract the Mirage 2000-5 BR would be assembled at the factory and Dassault would transfer all technology including software codes that allow flexibility int he choice of missiles to Embraer.
Winning the contract would also allow Embraer to export assembled mirages.
The competitors include Lockheed Martins' F-16 C, the JAS-39 Gripen built by a U.K.-Swedish consortium and two Russian planes called the MiG-29 and the Sukhoi Su-35.
Air Force experts are said to prefer the Sukhoi fighter but Botelho stated that national sovereignty should play an important role in the result.
Sao Paulo state is Brazil's richest and most industralized state.

Fathers of militants killed in Kashmir vow to continue support for independence
Mohammed Aziz's son Imam was killed in Kashmir in January 2002.
Militants fighting against Indian rule buried the son in the Himalayan forests.
Imam was Aziz's eldest son.
Aziz stated that he would not hesitate to sacrifice his remaining four sons for Kashmiri independence.
Aziz is angry that President Pervez Musharraf will obstruct Pakistan's the militant Islamic groups that send fighters into the Indian-ruled portion of Kashmir.
Aziz stated his pride of being a father of a martyr and that President Musharraf has sold the blood of hundreds of freedom fighters by stopping men from waging jihad in Kashmir.
Aziz was in Lahore near the Indian border south of Kashmir.
10000 people rallied on June 16, 2002 in Lahore including Aziz.
Political and religious groups vowed to fight for Kashmir despite Musharraf's promise to stop militants based in Pakistan from crossing into Indian-controlled territory to stage attacks.
Militant groups that oppose Musharraf's crackdown and Musharraf's support for the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan have been blamed for attacks targeting foreigners and symbols of Western influence in Pakistan.
This included a bombing outside the U.S. consulate in Karachi that killed 12 people in June 2002.
Musharraf pledged to stop cross-border infiltration because of pressure from the United States.
The United States fears the Kashmir crisis could trigger a full-scale conflict between India and Pakistan.
The dispute over Kashmir began when India and Pakistan gained independence from Britain in 1947.
The two countries both have nuclear weapons and have fought two wars over Kashmir.
There are increased tensions of war between India and Pakistan after an attack on an Indian army camp.
The attack killed 34 people and was one of the deadliest single assaults since 1989.
In 1989 militants launched an insurgency in Indian-controlled Kashmir seeking independence or a merger with Islamic Pakistan.
Kashmir is India's only Muslim-majority state.
India is dominated by Hinduism.
India accuses Islamabad of funding and training guerrillas.
The guerrillas cross the Line of Control that divides Kashmir and carry out attacks on the Indian side.
Tens of thousands of Indian troops, guerrillas and civilians have been killed.
Pakistan says it only provides moral and political support for Kashmir's named freedom fighters.
Diplomatic intervention and Musharraf's suppression of militants and cross-border attacks have decreased tensions of war.
There is strong resentment among Pakistan's conservative Islamic groups.
Fighter with Hezb-ul Mujahedeen Anas Javed said that Pakistan soldiers deployed near the Kashmir border used to pray for success in Jihad but are now terrorists according to Musharra.
Hezb-ul Mujahedeen is one of the main militant groups fighting in Kashmir.
The leaders of two other outlawed Pakistani militant groups that operate in Kashmir Lashkar-e-Tayyaba and Jaish-e-Mohammed are in police custody and under house arrest respectively.
Musharraf's crackdown has decreased tensions about war.
The dispute over Kashmir continues with no signs of abating.
A Board was created during the rally in Lahore bearing the names of militants killed during the 12-year insurgency.
Safdar Sadiqui's son was on it.
Sadiqui's son was killed in Kashmir in 1993 at age 22.
Islamic cleric Sadiqui stated that his son gave his life for Kashmir and that Sadiqui would do whatever possible to liberate Kashmir.
Sadiqui is associated with Pakistan's main hard-line religious group Jamaat-e-Islami.
Muslim cleric Mohammed Yousaf stated his anger at the Pakistan army for preventing men from fighting against India in Kashmir at the Line of Control.
Yousaf sat beside Sadiqui.
Yousaf said that Pakistan is incomplete without Kashmir.

Amgen Inc. invented EPO and shares patent rights with Johnson & Johnson and Kirin Brewery in the most lucrative industrialized markets -- the US, Europe and Japan.
In 2001 EPO generated 6 billion dollars in sales for the 3 corporations.
Amgen sells EPO in the US as epogen for over 36 dollars per dose.
US epogen consumers pay over 10000 dollars each annually for the drug.
EPO is a genetically engineered protein used legally by kidney dialysis and chemotherapy patients and illegally by athletes to increase the concentration of oxygenated red blood cells.
An increasing quantity of biotechnology drugs are produced without any attempts to obtain licenses in developing nations.
US patent holders consider the trade in generic drugs a violation to their intellectual property.
Consumers in developing countries appreciate lower prices on generic drugs.
Cuba considers the generic drug trade good business and currently manufactures EPO for sale in Argentina, Brazil, India and other countries that do not acknowledge most US and European drug patents.
Cuban biotechnology executive Blanca tormo stated that Cuba carefully abides by intellectual property laws and exclusively sells EPO in countries in which no entity has exclusive patent rights.
The largest potential pharmaceutical market is in the 1.3 billion person Chinese market.
Amgen, Kirin, the small Canadian biotechnology company Dragon Pharmaceuticals Inc. and at lease 4 Chinese companies currently sell EPO in China.
The generic product costs as low as 5 dollars per dose in China.
By joining the World Trade Organization in 2001 China agreed to abide by WTO intellectual property agreements but the agreements contain mechanisms allowing developing nations to circumvent patents, particularly in pharmaceuticals, when public health concerns are deemed to override the patents.
Current state of biotechnology in Cuba --
The Cuban biotechnology industry currently generates 100 million dollars annually and reaches markets in over 40 countries.
Cuba's genetic engineering and biotechnology center occupies modern towers approved by Fidel Castro and employs over 1000 people to engineer proteins to combat major terminal illnesses.
Cuba currently produces novel biotechnology products: hepatitis B and meningitis B vaccines, a skin growth factor, interferons, thrombosis and heart attack medicines and AIDS treatments.
Cuba has produced over 78 million doses of hepatitis B vaccine.
Cuba licensed its meningitis B vaccine to the British company GlaxoSmithKline, which hopes to eventually sell the vaccine in the United States under a Clinton-era exemption to the Cuban trade embargo.
Cuba is cooperating with the small Canadian company YM biosciences on trials of a head and neck cancer treatment.
Cuba is seeking further partnerships with foreign companies in vaccine research for AIDS, 8 types of cancer and cholera.
Cuban officials including attendees of the annual bio 2002 Industry Conference 20020600 in Toronto stated that negotiations for new biotechnology trade and production agreements were in progress with Brazil, Malaysia, Netherlands, Spain, Mexico, Venezuela, Vietnam, Ukraine, Germany and the United States.
Cuba has or is negotiating technology transfer agreements with 14 countries, chiefly developing nations including India, Algeria and South Africa.
20020500 US Undersecretary of State for Arms Control John Bolton stated that the US believes Cuba has at least a limited offensive biological warfare research and development effort and has provided dual-use biotechnology to other rogue states.
Scientists, Castro, and former US President Jimmy Carter, who visited Cuba directly after Bolton's statement, dismissed Bolton's statement as unfair.
Tormo stated that Bolton unintentionally increased publicity for the Cuban biotechnology program.

Russian military space forces put on test duty an optical space-object tracking facility located in the ex-Soviet republic of Tajikistan
The Russian military space forces on 020718 inaugurated an optical tracking facility that is intended to monitor objects in space and put it on test duty.
The okno optical tracking facility is near the town of Nurek in the central region of the ex-Soviet republic of Tajikistan and located 50 kilometers (30 miles) southeast of the Tajik capital Dushanbe.
Russian Space Forces said in a statement carried by the Interfax-military news agency that the okno (window) complex is capable of tracking objects 40000 kilometers (24800 miles) from Earth.
The okno offers a better range and precision than standard radar facilities according to the Space Forces.
The report did not elaborate on how the okno works.
The report saids Space Forces chief Col.-Gen. Anatoly Perminov traveled to the site to report on the facility's launch to Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov,.
According to images on the Federation of American Scientists' web site, the facility involves telescope-like equipment housed in several large spheres.
The okno is located in Tajikistan's mountains 2200 meters (7260 feet) above sea level and takes advantage of the area's fine weather and high transparency of the atmosphere.
Such conditions are not found elsewhere in the former Soviet Union.
The site describes it as similar to the U.S. GEODSS system, or ground-based electro-optical Deep Space Surveillance.
Three such U.S. facilities are operational.
The construction of the facility started in 790000, but stopped after the 910000 Soviet collapse when Tajikistan slid into a 5 year civil war that undermined its economy and left its population in deep poverty.
About 25000 Russian troops and border guards are deployed in Tajikistan to help protect its volatile southern border with Afghanistan and prevent drug smuggling.

Italy is leading a technology transfer initiative developed by the G-8 countries which will improve the technology of developing countries.
The goal of the initiative is to provide the infrastructure and good governance needed to alleviate poverty.
Italy sponsors technology transfer to developing countries as a form of foreign aid and alleviating poverty.
Premier Silvio Berlusconi supported and sponsored the initiative with counterparts at recent international gatherings including the last G-8 Summit in Canada.
Italy persuaded partners to let Italy lead the G-8 summit's e-government initiative called DOT Force or digital opportunity task force.
Former IBM executive and current technology minister of Italy Lucio Stanca is leading Italy's Internet program for developing countries as part of the Group of Eight's efforts to reduce the digital divides.
Silvio Berlusconi gave Lucio Stanca his current role of modernizing Italy's bureaucracy.
Lucio Stanca stated that Italy will not targeting countries that have very basic needs.
The first technology transfer projects will be implemented in the fall.
One such project is creating an electronic database for real estate in Mozambique.
So far 12 million euros or 12 million dollars have been allocated to finance the initial phase of these projects.
This cost is only a fraction of the total cost.
Italy is financing most of the cost but the World Bank and possibly some private telecommunications companies are also contributing.
Lucio Stanca stated that the world must solve the problem of world hunger, disease and education but in order to do that the world must first help create good governance.
The rationale behind creating good governance is that by making the public administration of developing countries more transparent and accountable developing countries would become more attractive potential recipients of traditional forms of aid such as loans and investments.
In effect good governance would invalidate the reason used by countries that do not do enough that donating is not appropriate because it is impossible to know whether the aid would reach its true destination.
The United Nations telecommunications agency stated that 83 countries in Africa, Asia, and the former Soviet Union still have less than 10 telephone lines for every 100 people.
Other studies note that even though the Internet has been in use for more than a decade, only about 10 percent of the world's population has access to it.
Reducing the digital divide has taken on a central role in the fight against global poverty in recent years.
The United Nations has repeatedly stated that the world's poor may be further marginalized if there is no improvement in access to information technology.
Reducing the digital divide was declared a priority at last year's G-8 Summit in Genoa which included Russia.
Italy launched pilot programs in 5 countries at a conference in Sicily sponsored by the United Nations and Italy in April, 2002.
The Conference focused on how technologies can be used to improve administration in developing countries.
The plan for Albania is computerization of demographic surveys.
The plan for Jordan is e-procurement which will allow online trading, auctions, payment and settlement of bills.
The plan for Tunisia is the creation of electronic databases to facilitate tax collection.
The plan for Nigeria and Mozambique is the creation an electronic database for real estate.
Washington-based adviser at World Learning Ann hudock stated that poverty reduction will only occur when the poor themselves are brought into the policy process.
Oxfram America is a nonprofit development group based in Boston.

Russian Navy, Air Force and space forces successfully carried out a series of test firings of missiles
Russian defense officials said the Russian Navy, Air Force and space forces successfully carried out a series of test firings of missiles on 021012.
A spokesman for the Russian Space Forces press service said the Russian Space Forces test-fired an RS-12 M Topol intercontinental ballistic missile.
The spokesman said the missile took off from the Plesetsk cosmodrome, about 1200 kilometers (800 miles) north of Moscow and hit the target at the Kura Test Range on the Kamchatka peninsula in Russia's Far East, about 7000 kilometers (4200 miles) away.
The spokesman said the launch was carried out by the Strategic Rocket Forces and space forces in accordance with schedule of troops military training.
Topol missiles have been on combat duty for 15 years and Russia periodically tests them to see if their lifetime can be extended.
A defense ministry spokesman said the Russian Navy's northern and Pacific fleets successfully test-fired ballistic missiles from nuclear submarines in the Barents Sea to the north and the Sea of Okhotsk.
The spokesman said the purpose of the tests was to check the efficiency of the military command bodies of the Russian armed forces.
Interfax news agency reported that 2 Russian strategic bombers on 021012 launched cruise missiles as part of a training exercise.
Interfax said a Tu-160 bomber and a Tu-95 MS bomber launched the missiles against targets located on the military testing grounds in the Volga region after a 12-hour training flight.

Indian Deputy Prime Minister accuses Pakistan of becoming a haven for terrorists escaped from Afghanistan and permitting increasing guerrilla attacks in Kashmir.
20021228 Indian Deputy Prime Minister Lal Krishna Advani stated at a gathering of paramilitary police officers in New Delhi --
Intelligence reports state that al-Qaeda members have fled from American forces in Afghanistan and relocated to western Pakistan and Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, making Pakistan the new epicenter of terrorism.
Cross-border incursions by Islamic guerrillas into Indian-controlled Kashmir increased in recent weeks.
The international community must beware of the situation, which could prove expensive for any country.
Pakistan's foreign ministry spokesman Aziz Ahmad Khan stated in Islamabad --
The accusations were without merit.
Indian leaders have previously leveled baseless allegations at Pakistan.
India should resolve its issues with Pakistan including the core issue of Kashmir to ensure durable peace in the region, rather than accuse Pakistan.
India has refused talks with Pakistan.
Pakistani and American officials stated that over 400 Taliban and al-Qaeda suspects have been arrested in Pakistan.
20021228 the head of the Pakistan-based guerrilla group Hezb-ul Mujahadeen Syed Salahuddin stated at a meeting of Hezb commanders in mazzafarabad, the capital of Pakistani Kashmir, that Hezb will continue and increase jihad in the Indian state of Jammu-Kashmir with full force.
Hezb is the largest of over 12 militias battling Indian troops for Kashmir's independence from mostly Hindu India, or its merger with Islamic Pakistan.
Advani stated --
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf's assurance to the United States of ending cross-border terrorism in Kashmir, terminating militant camps and banning dozens of Islamic groups was merely cosmetic.
Many of the banned terrorist groups continued activity in Pakistan and Kashmir under new names.
The Indian army stated that 4 Islamic militants were killed in 2 separate gun battles 20021228.
Indian army spokesman Lt.Col. Mukhtar Singh stated that soldiers stormed a militant hideout in Kreeri, a village 35 kilometers north of Srinagar, Jammu-Kashmir's summer capital.
2 militants identified as members of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Tayyaba group were killed.
Approximately 25 kilometers southwest of Sringar 2 militants were killed in a second gun battle.
Local police reported 4 civilians wounded in the crossfire.
India and Pakistan have fought 2 of 3 wars over control of Kashmir.
Both countries claim the entirety of the region.
The Islamic insurgency in Kashmir has lasted 13 years and killed over 61000 people.
India accuses Pakistan of funding and training the cross-border guerrillas.
Pakistan claims it offers moral rather than material support to the rebels, whom it considers freedom fighters.

A virus-like computer infection spread through Asian digital networks and disrupted Internet services in several countries.
The virus is thought to have utilized a security flaw in microsoft software.
A virus-like computer infection spread through worldwide digital networks and interrupted Internet service in parts of Asia on 25 January 2003.
The infection slowed or halted web browsing and e-mail services in several countries.
Users and news media reported outages or slowdowns in Thailand, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, South Korea and India.
Internet service providers said a sudden surge in traffic jammed networks on the afternoon of 25 January 2003.
Antivirus vendor Symantec Corp. estimated at least 22000 systems were affected worldwide.
A technical support representative for Internet Thailand stated --
A virus or worm attacked a bug in microsoft software.
While traffic among domestic Thai servers was normal, exchanges with international servers began slowing down around 12:00 pm (0500 GMT).
The exchanges came to a halt within hours before recovering the evening of 25 January 2003.
U.S. officials stated the attack sought out vulnerable computers on the Internet using a known flaw in software from Microsoft Corp. called SQL server 2000.
The attacking software code scanned for victim computers randomly and aggressively and sent out thousands of probes each second which overwhelmed many Internet data pipelines.
Local Thai subscribers stated that other Thai Internet service providers appeared to be unaffected.
NHK television in Japan reported --
Some of the Japan's Internet connections experienced heavy traffic.
A public university computer had been hit by over 200000 transmissions in 1 hour.
Security firms were investigating the incident.
Traffic-directing computers at Korea Telecom freetel and SK Telecom failed to function in South Korea and affected millions of Internet users.
Chief system engineer at KT freetel Kim Chang-Rae stated excessive traffic caused 1 of KT freetel's main domain servers to fail which forced other servers to shut down in a chain reaction.
Officials stated the system was restored after several hours but service remained slow.
The failure affected weekend Internet banking and shopping traffic ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday.
Chunghwa Telecom Co. Ltd. is 1 of the largest Internet providers in Taiwan.
A customer service operator from Chunghwa Telecom Co. Ltd. stated service experienced difficulties and that some customers weren't able to access the web.
The operator would not state how many customers were affected.
Privately-owned Internet service provider timedotcom in Malaysia stated timedotcom had received numerous complaints from customers of partial or no access to the Internet.
Internet users in New Delhi reported service interruptions but no problems were reported in India's software development centers of Hyderabad and Bangalore.
Internet service provider sky Internet Inc. in the Philippines reported an increase in signals early on 25 January 2003 and stated the increase was an apparent attempt to congest the network.
Sky Internet Inc. workers temporarily shut down dial-up service in response to the increase in signals.
Technical operator at Sky Internet Inc. Dan Rebueno stated several signals came from an outside source that workers at Sky Internet Inc. could not identify and the Workers blocked the congestion attempts.
Rebueno stated sky Internet Inc. is currently up on a normal workload.
Officials in the United States said the attack on 25 January 2003 bore similarities to a Code Red virus in the summer of 2001 which also halted traffic on much of the Internet.
In May 2000 the so-called love bug virus was released in the Philippines and overwhelmed e-mail systems worldwide.
The virus caused 10s of millions of dollars in damage.
Prosecutors in the Philippines dismissed all charges against a man accused of releasing the virus because of a lack of applicable laws.

Philippine intelligence reports reveal Singapore-based al-Qaida group's plans to bomb embassies, U.S. corporations, and warships in Singapore and to crash hijacked planes at Singapore's National Airport.
The plans were successfully stopped in their final stages in December 2001 and 15 cell members were arrested.
Philippine intelligence reports obtained by the Associated Press reveal a Singapore-based al-Qaida group's plans to attack embassies of the United States, Great Britain, Israel and Australia, to attack U.S. corporations and warships in Singapore and to crash a hijacked plane at the country's international airport.
The group ordered a chemist to buy 4 tons of ammonium nitrate.
The amount is 4 times the amount of explosive that Timothy McVeigh used to bomb the Oklahoma City Federal Building.
The embassy attacks were successfully stopped in the final stages by U.S. investigators and allies in Southeast Asia but the explosives were not recovered.
1 of the phillipine reports states that Singapore is a target for terrorist attacks because of its 17000 U.S. residents and 6000 multinational companies including several American companies.
The terrorists belonged to Jemaah Islamiah designated by the U.S. government as a terrorist organization and described in 1 of the phillipine reports as part of the broader al-Qaida syndicate.
The group planned attacks in Singapore before and after the hijackings in the United States on 11 September 2001.
The group is believed responsible for attacks throughout Southeast Asia.
The group is suspected in the bombings in Bali that killed approximately 200 people in October 2002.
The attacks in Singapore were prevented after 15 individuals were arrested in December 2001.
2 of the individuals arrested were released.
1 of the Philippine reports stated that local officials and Western business executives were shocked by the ability of Al-Qaida to plant operatives in such a tightly controlled society as Singapore.
The members of the 4 or 5-man terror cells led normal lives and avoided contact with known Islamic organizations.
The members were not known to be active members of mosques in Singapore.
In efforts to avoid detection the members used code names and code numbers, communicated by e-mail, encrypted their computer diskettes and used prepaid mobile phone cards.
Investigators stated that after the U.S. military campaign began in Afghanistan members of Jemaah Islamiah planned to procure 21 tons of explosive materials and bought 4 tons of ammonium nitrate in an operation to attack embassies in Singapore.
The ammonium nitrate was purchased by captured Malaysian chemist and retired army captain Yazid Sufaat.
Authorities state that Sufaat hosted 11 September hijackers and the accused terrorism suspect Zacarias Moussaoui in Malaysia at different times in 2000.
Authorities state that Sufaat provided Moussaoui with counterfeit documents with which to enter the United States.
Moussaoui was arrested in August 2001 in Minnesota and remains the only U.S. defendant indicted as a conspirator with the perpetrators of the 11 September attacks.
The Singaporean cell members were believed to be conducting reconnaissance when they were apprehended.
The explosive materials were sent to an Indonesian island off Singapore.
During the attack planning an Indonesian and a Kuwaiti arrived in Singapore with instructions for the embassy operations.
Cell members guided them to the U.S. embassy which was videotaped including close-up shots.
The adjoining Australian embassy was also videotaped.
In a separate plot a member of the cell took digital photographs of U.S. military aircraft and personnel using Singapore's Paya Lebar air base.
Singapore authorities believe a cell leader traveled to Afghanistan and briefed al-Qaida leaders about the proposed shuttle bus attack between August 1999 and April 2000.
The al-Qaida officials apparently turned down the plan because the target was not large enough.
A few days after the Singapore arrests in December 2001 a videotape was found in an abandoned house in Kabul, Afghanistan in which a narrator describes locations in Singapore where bombs could be hidden to attack Americans.
Investigators searched the homes of those detained in Singapore and found an identical videotape.
The Singapore wing of Jemaah Islamiah may also have Thai connections since at least 5 members who eluded the 2001 arrests fled to Thailand.
1 of the reports stated --
The group had previously plotted to conduct 7 simultaneous explosions in different areas of Singapore.
The Group had further planned to hijack a U.S., British or Singaporean plane and crash it into Changi Airport in order to threaten the U.S. government to halt its military strikes against Afghanistan.
In February 2003 Indonesian police announced the arrest of the alleged head of the cell in Singapore Mas Selamat Kastari who was suspected of planning the airport attack.
Kastari also was suspected in the proposed shuttle bus attack.
The reports arose after intelligence agents from Southeast Asian countries realized after the 11 September 2001 attacks that many radical Islamic groups in the region had close connections to each other and to Osama bin Laden's terrorist network.

The defense ministers of France and India met April 28, 2003 to discuss how India can improve defense technology with France's guidance.
India is expected to close multiple deals with France soon regarding the purchase of military equipment.
Government representatives of India and France stated April 28, 2003 that the 2 countries are making progress on India's plans to purchase French-made submarines and military aircraft.
French Defense Minister Michele Alliot-Marie stated after talks with Indian Defense Minister George Fernandez that the defense partnership between India and France is exemplary in intensity and diversity.
Michele Alliot-Marie completed a 3-day visit to India on April 28, 2003.
The political situation in Iraq after the fall of Saddam Hussein, Afghanistan and the global fight against terrorism influenced Michele Alliot-Marie's visit.
Michele Alliot-Marie stated that India is considering many new contracts for French submarines, military aircraft and other defense equipment.
India and France will soon conclude a 2 billion dollar agreement to build 6 Scorpene submarines in India under a technology transfer deal.
The deal is still awaiting final approval by the Indian Cabinet Committee on Security.
The deal would allow the submarines to be supplied to the Indian Navy between 2010 and 2015.
The submarines would be armed with French-made Exocet anti-ship missiles.
Michele Alliot-Marie stated that talks are likely to result in the successful completion of the deal by the end of 2003.
The Indian Air Force is considering buying 130 multi-role fighter planes to replace its aging Soviet-made MiG aircraft.
France has been attempting to sell Mirage-V fighter jets to India for 5 years.
Defense deals take years to conclude in India because every agreement must be approved by several ministries and can be stalled by opposition parties.
Michele Alliot-Marie stated that the 2 sides in the Indian government have the competence and equivalent interests in defense cooperation and that the two sides must work together for deals to be completed.
The governments of India and France share the position that the United Nations should lead efforts for the physical reconstruction of Iraq and that the political reconstruction of Iraq should be the responsibility of the local people.
Michele Alliot-Marie stated that it is critical that Iraqi people take charge of the political restructuring of Iraq.

Taiwanese Vice President Annette Lu warned that European transfer of European technology to the People's Republic of China could encourage the PRC government to invade Taiwan.
Taiwanese Vice President Annette Lu warned on 040212 that the transfer of European technology to the People's Republic of China could encourage the PRC government to invade Taiwan.
Lu noted that the European Union adopted a resolution to ban arms sales to mainland China after the Tiananmen massacre of 890000 and said it is worrisome that the leaders of France and Germany are reportedly seeking to lift the ban following years of commercial interest enticements by the PRC government.
Lu expressed concern that European advanced technology will be transferred to the mainland and added that such transfers would be helpful for the PRC government's military buildup and will therefore encourage an invasion of Taiwan by the mainland.
Lu said that the government of mainland China has tried to isolate Taiwan diplomatically and has been increasing its military buildup against Taiwan.
Lu said the PRC government has deployed around 500 missiles targeting Taiwan and the number of missiles deployed is expected to increase to 650 next year.
Lu described the PRC government as a real international terrorist because of the threat of missiles aimed at Taiwan and the PRC's preparations to invade Taiwan.
Lu added that this is why Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian called for a peace referendum for 040320 alongside the Taiwanese presidential election.
Lu said European nations should not join the PRC government in opposing Taiwan's planned referendum.
Lu said that Taiwan is not a part of the People's Republic of China and has maintained substantive relations with almost all countries around the world even though most of them do not have diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
Taiwan has never ceased making efforts to participate in international activities and has made great contributions to global development despite being refused membership by many international organizations.
Lu's remarks were made at Taiwan's presidential office while receiving the mayor of the Austrian city of Innsbruck Hilde Zach.
Zach arrived in Taipei Tuesday for a 6-day visit at the invitation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Zach hopes to gain a better understanding of Taiwan's development in the political, economic, cultural and tourism fields.

Taiwan Executive Yuan may not approve Taiwanese participation in the construction of submarines sold from the United States.
A delegation of Taiwanese legislators completed an 11-day fact-finding trip to the United States.
The Taiwan Executive Yuan submitted a NT $610.8 billion (US $18.23 billion) special budget to buy 388 Patriot PAC-III missiles, 8 conventional submarines and 12 P-3 C anti-submarine aircraft from the United States earlier this month.
The budget is now pending approval by the Legislative Yuan.
Ker Chien-ming, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) whip at the Taiwan legislature said on 040628 that discussions are turning negative in regard to whether the China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) should take part in the construction of submarines which the United States has promised to sell to Taiwan.
Navy Commander-in-Chief Miao Yung-Ching called on the Legislative Yuan to communicate on the review of the arms procurement budget of which the submarine deal is a part.
Miao said it is not feasible for CSBC to take part in the construction of the submarines and that the Navy will negotiate with the United States on obtaining repair capacity and technology transfers.
Miao said that no countries want to buy conventional submarines.
This would make it futile to give the CSBC the capacity to build them.
The United States has control of the key technology in building the submarines.
Lee Wen-chung is another DPP legislator who has been involved.
Lee said on 040628 that the delegation asked the United States to shorten the delivery period of the submarines from 15 years to 10 years.
This indicates that Taiwan has already given up the policy of building the submarines itself.
Lee said that if the submarines are not built by Taiwan then the cost of the eight subs will be NT $100 billion less than the original plan of NT $400 billion.
Lee's figures were based on the price tags of submarines sold from Germany and Spain along with the cost of obtaining repair capacity.
Lee was asked if the long delivery period of 10 years might affect Taiwan's military strength and tip the military cross-Taiwan Strait balance toward mainland China after 050000.
Lee answered that any possible naval military balance tilting toward the PRC after 050000 would not mean an eruption of war at that time.
Lee claimed that Taiwan still enjoys the edge in the air.
Lee added that an order of Kidd-class destroyers due to arrive at Taiwan by the end of next year would allow Taiwan to still maintain its edge.
Lee also said that the United States will deliver the first 5 of 12 P-3 C aircraft in 080000, with another 3 in 090000, 4 in 100000 and the final 4 in 110000.

The process to try to control and reduce arms in the embattled Balkans was formally launched in Bonn, Germany, when foreign ministers, ambassadors and representatives of international organizations and observer nations met to discuss what form further talks should take.
The long process to try to control and reduce arms in the embattled Balkans was formally launched on 951218 in Bonn, Germany.
Foreign ministers, ambassadors and representatives of international organizations and observer nations met in Bonn to discuss what form further talks should take.
There are huge obstacles to achieving peace and cooperation among combatants in the former Yugoslavia.
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said in opening remarks at the one-day meeting that there can be no peace in the former Yugoslavia if some parties to the conflict remain heavily armed and others try to catch up.
The Croation delegation threatened to pull out of arms-reduction negotiations if certain demands were not met in the nearest future.
Delegates from other countries called on Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia to set aside their grievances and learn to compromise.
Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic complained that a part of Croatian territory is under occupation and time is running out.
Granic said in reference to disputed lands on the Croatian-Serbian border that the peaceful re-integration of Eastern Slavonia is the key to the lasting stability in the region and that everyone faces the danger of another round of hostilities and the destabilization of the whole region and highly unpredictable consequences for Bosnia-Herzegovina without it.
Conference participants said Foreign Minister Milan Milutinovic from Serbia scolded his Croatian counterpart for grandstanding.
Then Milutinovic made a threat to pull out of arms-control negotiations.
Milutinovic noted the Serbian Government has been suspended since 920000 from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and said that unless full membership were restored Yugoslavia will be prevented from cooperating despite its readiness to do so.
The OSCE is to oversee the next round of Balkan arms-reduction talks.
Michael Williams is a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London and formerly the United Nations' senior spokesman for Croatia and called the early threats from Croatia and Serbia a worrying development and an ominous development.
Williams said it was really not clear that the parties are willing to engage in any arms control in a meaningful way.
This corresponds to a fear expressed by some delegates to the 951218 Bonn meeting that the yugolav parties do not want to negotiate away the ability to use violence or a threat of violence to seize territory.
Greek Foreign Minister karelos Papoulias observed of the Balkan belligerents that during talk in the plenary session one realizes that this is still the way they are thinking.
Papoulias said the Greek government is not as optimistic as other European partners and that just because there is a Conference doesn't mean there is friendship between the people of the former Yugoslavia.
The 951218 talks were organized to fulfill the combatants' pledge made in Dayton, Ohio, to begin talks to enhance mutual confidence and reduce the risk of conflict within 7 days of the Peace Accord's formal signing.
The agenda on 951218 was limited to set the formal process for coming weeks.
The German Foreign Ministry said in a statement that this was so as to clear the way for speedy negotiation of the substantive questions.
Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia are the nations that signed the Dayton accord and are supposed to report how many tanks and armored vehicles, heavy artillery pieces, combat aircraft and attack helicopters they possess in the next phase.
This data will be used to establish baselines from which weapons ceilings can be agreed on.
Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia have promised to accept a set of automatic limits if agreement on such ceilings cannot be reached in 180 days.
Kinkel said that on 951218 delegates had been unable to fix a date for the next round of talks but said the next talks would be 960104 or 960107 in Vienna.
Kinkel said minor problems not substantive discord kept delegates from choosing a firm date.

Indian officials seize missile assembly line from the North Korean vessel the kuwolsan on 30 June 1999.
The discovery heightens suspicions of North Korean weapons proliferation.
On 30 June 1999 Indian customs agents in the northwestern port city of Kandla boarded the North Korean freighter kuwolsan.
Following a melee with the crew of the kuwolsan, customs agents discovered an assembly line for ballistic missiles.
U.S. intelligence officials stated Libyan government was the intended recipient of the cargo.
The kuwolsan departed North Korea's Nampo harbor on 10 April 1999.
Records show that on 20 April 1999 the kuwolsan made detours to 2 Thai ports to pick up 14000 tons of sugar for resale along the way to the kuwolsan's destination.
The kuwolsan switched course in order to sell the sugar to an Indian company after a deal to sell the sugar to Algerians failed.
An Indian investigator stated that the crew of the kuwolsan should not have picked up extra cargo at several ports when carrying 200 tons of sensitive equipment and that such activity was crazy.
Indian customs officials were tipped off to possible contraband on the kuwolsan while the kuwolsan was en route to Kandla.
The kuwolsan was rumored to be carrying arms or ammunition possibly intended for Pakistan.
Indian port officials were waiting when the kuwolsan arrived in Kandla on 25 June 1999.
Irregularities in the kuwolsan's papers were apparent within the first few hours of investigation.
Indian officials learned that the company in Malta listed as the intended recipient of the cargo was fictitious.
Indian officials questioned why anyone in Malta would choose to buy water refining equipment from North Korea when Malta is a short flight from Europe.
Indian customs agents questioned the captain of the kuwolsan Tae Min Hun.
Tae blocked every request and threatened international reprisals if Indian officials did not allow Tae to leave Kandla.
On 30 June 1999 customs officials demanded to search the kuwolsan's cargo boxes and Tae stated that the kuwolsan had received a telex from North Korean officials.
Tae received instructions from officials in Pyongyang to allow no one to open the cargo boxes at all costs.
The official Indian after-action report stated Tae would not open any more boxes as per the telex.
The report stated the crew members shouted at and abused the customs officers.
According to witness accounts and video footage of the encounter, tae and the crew of the kuwolsan barricaded the doors of the kuwolsan with the crews' bodies.
An Indian official who was present on the kuwolsan and who spoke on the condition of anonymity stated the situation became physical and there were fisticuffs.
The official stated the crew began closing the hatches to the cargo hold with the customs inspectors still inside.
On 1 July 1999 armed troops and a group of government weapons experts aided customs officials and gained forcible entry onto the kuwolsan.
A few crates among the kuwolsan's cargo contained equipment that could be used in a water treatment plant.
Inspectors found pumps, nozzles and a few valves.
The cargo boxes were labeled as water refinement equipment.
Documents from the investigation contain a partial list of the contents of most of the cargo crates which included --
Components for missile subassembly.
Machine Tools for setting up a fabrication facility.
Instrumentation for evaluating the performance of a full missile system.
Equipment for calibrating missile components.
Rocket nose cones, stacks of metal pipe and heavy-duty presses used for milling high-grade steel.
A Plate-bending machine capable of rolling thick metal sheets, toroidal air bottles used to guide warheads after separation from a missile, and Theodolites that measure missile trajectories.
Several boxes of engineering drawings, blueprints, notebooks, textbooks and reports.
Personal items presumably intended for North Korean workers, including cookbooks in Korean, Korean spices, pickles and acupuncture sets.
An Indian government official familiar with the kuwolsan discovery stated that in the past officials had seen missiles or engine parts, but here was an entire assembly line for missiles offered for sale.
The official stated that this was a complete technology transfer.
A technical committee of Indian missile experts stated that the equipment was unimpeachable and irrefutable evidence of a plan to transfer not just missiles but missile-making capability.
The technical panel wrote in a report that the cargo points to only one end-use, namely the assembling of missiles and manufacture of the parts and subassemblies of surface to surface missiles.
Investigators searched the blueprints that were kept inside numbered plastic jackets and wrapped in brown paper.
Some of the packets were labeled in English as Scud B or Scud C. Nearly all of the drawings showed rockets or sections of rockets with notes and mathematical formulas handwritten in Korean.
Native Korean speakers assisted in translation but the documents contained technical code invented by North Korean scientists to replace scientific terms in Russian or Chinese.
The investigation ultimately yielded information about North Korea's weapons program which Indian authorities shared with ally Governments.
The Scud B and Scud C designs found on the kuwolsan were from older North Korean missile programs which were derived from Soviet missile designs of the 1950s.
One Indian government official who studied the blueprints stated the science was old and dated but still functional.
Retired director of the State Department's Office on strategic, proliferation and military issues in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research Greg Thielmann stated the CIA utilized the blueprints to make full mock-ups of missiles complete with decals.
The blueprints included information pertaining to the inner workings of North Korea's missile industry which has been the focus of contention between the United States and North Korea since the 1980s.
The cargo on the kuwolsan did not include everything needed for missile production which raises the possibility that there may have been earlier and possible later shipments.
Missile expert and senior analyst at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies Timothy V. McCarthy examined some of the blueprints and other evidence and stated this was a slice in time of a technology transfer from North Korea to Libya.
McCarthy stated the intelligence find helps U.S. officials learn how North Korean missile scientists learn.
McCarthy stated the information gives U.S. officials an idea of how capable North Korean scientists are of progressing to more advanced missiles and gives U.S. officials insight into the aspect of proliferation when one country's officials attempt to transfer technology to another country's officials.
McCarthy stated no one can stop Libyan scientists once the scientists are capable of making missiles.
The kuwolsan and the crew were unaccounted for after Indian officials released the kuwolsan in 2000.
Shipping experts at Lloyd's maritime division in London stated the kuwolsan's name was changed in the summer of 2000 to Sun grisan 9.
As of the week of 3 August 2003 the sun grisan 9 was still in service and was last reported headed to the Somalian capital of Mogadishu.
The nature of the Sun grisan 9's cargo was unknown.
As of 14 August 2003 the evidence from the kuwolsan is secured in a military warehouse in New Delhi.
As stated in court documents and interviews with officials in the United States and India the kuwolsan incident has reinforced a view of North Korea as the world's most dangerous source of weapons proliferation.
In 1999 North Korean leader Kim Jong Il expelled U.N. inspectors, abandoned the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and declared plans to build an atomic weapon.
U.S. intelligence officials stated that North Korean officials are continuing global trade in technology for weapons of mass destruction including instructions for making advanced missiles.
Successive U.S. administrations have condemned North Korea's missile sales to such countries as Iran and Syria.
On 31 August 1998 North Korean officials launched a 3-stage missile which heightened fears of advanced North Korean designs capable of reaching the U.S. mainland.
The first stage splashed down in the Sea of Japan, the second stage crossed the main island of Japan and the third broke up and traveled 3450 miles downrange and fell into the Pacific Ocean.
The missile test fueled work on a U.S. missile defense shield.
North Korean officials have defended the right to sell weapons and have stated that North Korean officials are not bound by international treaties restricting such trade.
North Korean officials have sold missiles and parts to Yemen which received 15 Scud missiles after the missiles were briefly intercepted by U.S. and Spanish naval crews off the Yemeni coast in December 1998.
Libya appears to be the latest beneficiary of North Korean weapons.
Other nations including Iran, Pakistan and Syria are known to have received similar help.
The kuwolsan cargo attests to the existence of a gray zone composed of a combination of weak States, open borders, lack of controls and a market of buyers and sellers of weapons of mass destruction.
Small packages are sometimes delivered in the luggage of individual airline passengers such as a Taiwanese businessman arrested at Zurich's airport in 2000 with North Korean missile parts in a rucksack.
Larger items are moved in freighters such as the kuwolsan while technical information and designs are accessible via the Internet.
Korea specialist with the Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies in California Daniel pinkston stated that intercepting weapons and equipment is difficult but not impossible but that human exchanges of plans, data, and intellectual property are difficult to intercept.

A high-security Russian laboratory complex storing anthrax, plague and other deadly bacteria faces loosing electricity for lack of payment to the mosenergo electric utility.
A large repository of anthrax, plague and other deadly bacteria stored in a high-security Russian laboratory complex 100 miles south of Moscow is facing the threat of loosing electricity.
An official from the Moscow region's mosenergo electric utility arrived recently at the Russian laboratory complex and threatened to turn off the electricity for lack of payment.
The Russian laboratory complex is a 90-building campus and served as the location for Russia's secret biological weapons program in the Soviet era.
An incorrect headline in the newspaper Izvestia stated that deadly viruses from a Moscow regional depository threaten Moscow.
There are no viruses at the State Scientific Center of applied Microbiology in obolensk.
At the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology there is every kind of deadly bacteria that was studied for use in the secret biological weapons program of the Soviet Union.
A large virus repository is located in Siberia.
Both Russian and Western officials have stated that it is unlikely that any public health threat would result from a power cutoff at the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology.
Russian and Western officials have stated that there is enough uncertainty that they could not be positive a loss of power at the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology would not cause a public health threat.
General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology has quite reliable systems of protection in case of emergency.
General Nikolai N. Urakov is the longtime director of the the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology.
The State scientific center of applied microbiology has been working with Western scientists to convert the complex into a biomedical manufacturing site.
General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that the people at the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology are scared by this threat of a sudden shutdown of electricity because it is a kind of psychological pressure on the people at the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology.
General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that in the event of a power shutdown at the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology scientists must destroy all bacteriological experiments under way.
General Nikolai N. Urakov would like the United States and Western countries that have contributed about 6 million United States dollars to the transformation of the former bioweapons complex to contribute another 500000 United States dollars per year to pay the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology's electric bills and arrears.
An American scientist who works closely with the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology stated that the Russian government was responsible for paying for the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology's electric bills.
Western aid for conversion of General Nikolai N. Urakov's one time bioweapons laboratory peaked in 970000 because it was learned that Iran had made offers to the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology to purchase its expertise.
Russian scientists and military leaders who now depend on Western financing to destroy nuclear, chemical and biological weapons have been known to orchestrate a sense of crisis to increase financing.
American scientist Randall Lee Beatty is working on the conversion of the State Scientific Center of applied Microbiology in obolensk.
Beatty stated that this threat to cut electricity to the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology is a crisis.
Randall Lee Beatty is a Director of the International Science and Technology Center.
The International Science and Technology Center finances approximately half of General Nikolai N. Urakov's budget to support about 350 Russian biowarfare scientists and technicians.
Randall Lee Beatty stated that it is known that the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology has not paid its electricity bill for 14 months.
Randall Lee Beatty stated that the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology is one of the important archives for dangerous pathogens in the world and it would be a shame if those archives were destroyed for not paying the electricity utility.
Approximately 3000 strains of bacteria are stored at the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology and many of the bacteria are stored in cryogenic casks cooled with liquid nitrogen and isolated from the environment by layered enclosures and oversize air-handling systems that all depend on electricity to function.
The greatest danger from a shutdown of electric power at the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology would be the defrosting of live germs that are currently preserved in a frozen state.
A biological warfare expert at the Monterey Institute of International Studies named Raymond zilinskas stated that the main threat from cutting power to the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology would be to the organisms themselves rather than that they might escape.
Raymond zilinskas stated that in the worst case the bacteria would be defrosted from minus 70 degrees and it would be a real mess to clean up afterward because it would not be known for certain whether all the bacteria was dead.
The confrontation between the mosenergo electric utility and the State Scientific Center of applied Microbiology in obolensk is another example of how the basic capitalist imperative for enterprises to be self-sustaining can clash in a dangerous way with the old remnants of Soviet weapons science.
Due to an overdue power bill in 000000 the Russian National Power Company cut off electricity to a strategic base where nuclear missiles stood on high alert.
The nuclear missile silos themselves did not lose power.
Armed troops marched to the substations and turned the power back on.
In 010100 and 010200 the national utility, United energy systems cut power to a number of military installations around Russia.
The military installations that lost power included the Russian space forces monitoring center on the Kamchatka Peninsula.
In most cases of military installations having their electricity cut off the electricity has been quickly restored.
Often investigations show that the tug of war with the utility forces the military to spend budgeted funds for electrical power instead of diverting money for other uses.
Some of the budgeted funds cut at times have included the building country residences for generals.

Brazil to implement law allowing air force to target drug trafficking aircraft in Brazilian airspace.
US concerned over liability in the event of misidentification of a civilian plane.
Brazil announced that the air force will begin shooting down aircraft used in trafficking illegal drugs in Brazilian airspace.
The plan requires 8 precautionary steps before the order to shoot down a plane may be issued.
Prior to the policy taking effect late 20041000 a publicity campaign will notify ranchers and others of the need to file flight plans.
The Law to permit such an action was originally approved in 1998 but 1995-2003 President Fernando Henrique Cardoso never put the policy into effect.
The United States dissuaded Cardoso from signing the decree out of concern that the accidental downing of civilian aircraft could expose the US government and companies to lawsuits.
20010400 the United States reduced previous support for operations targeting drug-running aircraft when a Peruvian jet shot down a small plane misidentified as a drug carrier and killed an American missionary and her child.
Relatives of the victims sued the US government and won a settlement due to the Government's provision of intelligence and technical support to the operation.
A US State Department official stated --
US law may forbid assistance to countries that implement shoot-down laws under certain conditions.
The US agrees with the Brazilian assessment that the threat posed by drug traffickers is both very serious and increasing.
The US government has consulted the Brazilian Government about the provisions of US law.
Brazilian Defense Minister Jose Viegas stated that Brazil has encountered difficulties in securing US support for the plan but recent bilateral talks led to certainty that the decree would be accepted by the US government without exposing Brazil to commercial sanctions.
Brazilian officials have expressed hope that the policy will be endorsed by the US before going into effect.
The US is scheduled to provide 10.2 million dollars in drug and law enforcement aid to Brazil in 2004.
Former air force chief and current Director of the Air Institute at estacio de sa University in Rio de Janeiro General Mauro Jose Miranda gandra stated that the measure was a courageous step by the Government but the impact may be more political than practical because of self-imposed restrictions by the Brazilian government.
Brazilian officials stated that the policy would be inapplicable against aircraft with children on board.
Viegas stated that the limitation was necessary.
Gandra stated that the provision undermines the decree's essential purpose by granting immunity to drug-smuggling aircraft carrying children and thus introducing the possibility of kidnapped children being used as human shields.
Viegas stated in an interview in Brasilia that the government will use the law to more powerfully dissuade drug traffickers who have previously entered Brazilian airspace feeling unthreatened by the air force.
The Government was prompted to act due to the deteriorating public security situation with increasingly powerful and violent drug gangs in Sao Paolo and particularly Rio de Janeiro.
Rio de Janeiro drug gangs have more firepower than the police and have successfully attacked police stations and forced businesses and schools to close.
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva stated in a 2003 interview with foreign correspondents --
The policy is a matter of national sovereignty and security.
Some pilots of drug-running aircraft felt so confidently immune from retribution as to make obscene gestures at pursuing Brazilian air force pilots.
The constitutionality of the law has been questioned under Brazil's prohibition of the death penalty as punishment for criminal acts.
Some legal experts and other commentators stated that contrary to government claims, the Statute amounts to a de facto execution of drug traffickers.
The daily newspaper O Estado de Sao Paolo stated in an editorial the week of 20040718-20040824 -- the extreme measure raises ethical and juridical problems exceeding any potential benefits.
The penalty will be applied extrajudicially by administrative decision of the Commander of the Air Force.
This person will gain life and death power over crew members and passengers of irregular flights.
In 2002 Brazil inaugurated the 1.4 billion dollar SIVAM radar system allowing the government to monitor air activity throughout the expansive Amazon region for the first time.
The system uses American technology.
Illegal Flights initially declined 30 percent due to trafficker's concerns about improved tracking capabilities but subsequently reaccelerated.
Brazil recorded 4128 unauthorized flights in 2003.
Some of these flights were innocent violations by ranchers in the Amazon flying between plantations.
Viegas stated that there was a significant increase in deliberate violations of Brazilian airspace, apparently by drug smugglers realizing that the government was incapable of retaliation.
20010400 Rio de Janeiro's most notorious drug boss, Fernandinho Beira-Mar, was captured in Colombia in a guns-for drugs pipeline involving left-wing guerrillas.
Brazil's northern Amazon corridor has become an increasingly busy and essential route in the global drug trade and is used for smuggling arms, gold and diamonds.
Reportedly one of the most important drug- and gun-smuggling routes in supplying Europe with cocaine runs from Colombia across the northern tier of the Amazon to Suriname.
Colombia is the only country that currently has a policy of targeting drug trafficking aircraft.
Colombia is the source of much of the cocaine and heroin sold in the United States.

The Venezuelan president's weapons deals with Russia, curbs on military cooperation with the United States, and his plans to train as many as 2 million Venezuelan civilians to repel a possible invasion by superpowers have the US and his domestic critics worried.
Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez's weapons deals with Russia, curbs on military cooperation with the United States, and plans to train as many as 2 million Venezuelan civilians to repel a possible invasion by imperialist superpowers have the United States and Chavez's domestic critics worried about what the leftist former military officer is planning.
Chavez insists that the moves are purely defensive and born of an overdue need to update obsolete military hardware and protect Venezuela from nations that might want to take control of Venezuela.
Venezuela is South America's largest petroleum-producing state.
Chavez's domestic opponents scoff at the idea that the US would ever invade Venezuela and charge that Chavez's true intention is to arm a huge cadre of loyal reservists who would protect Chavez against any internal uprising and to pose as a militarized counterweight to US influence in Latin America.
Cuban leader Fidel Castro is Chavez's his major ally and Chavez is growing closer to Castro.
Chavez's detractors in the US government say that it is even more troubling that Chavez's arms purchases and indoctrination of civilian militias could be part of a strategy to restructure Venezuelan democracy in the image of Cuban-style militarized socialism and foment leftist revolutions throughout South America.
US military strategists say they are increasingly concerned that radical movements inspired by Chavez could foment such revolution.
The political mainstream in Latin America has shifted leftward since the late 1990s.
This leftward shift is largely in reaction to the perceived failure of free-market economics.
Leftists have been elected to lead Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Ecuador and Venezuela.
Chavez's supporters at home counter that the United States has a century-long history of open as well as covert armed intervention in Latin America's domestic politics and say that it has no right to question Venezuela's defense preparations.
Carlos Roque Espinoza Leon said that Venezuelans never ask what the US Marines are doing.
Espinoza Leon is a pro-Chavez defense specialist who serves in Venezuela's National Assembly.
Espinoza said that Peru has 500000 rifles and no one says anything.
Espinoza said no one complains that Colombia is the most militarized country in Latin America.
Espinoza said US history is full of aggression in Latin America.
Espinoza said Venezuelans have to do whatever is necessary to protect Venezuela.
Chavez has famously said that the Venezuelan so-called Bolivarian revolution is peaceful but not unarmed.
Chavez was first elected in 980000 and has a popularity rating of 71 percent in an independent poll by polling firm Datanalisis.
Venezuelan military analyst Alberto Garrido said Chavez is looking for allies in Russia, China, and Iran in order to promote a multi-polar world which will counteract US dominance and encourage grassroots Movements in Latin America to throw off US governmental influence.
Lorenzo Campos is a farmer in Anzoategui state in northern Venezuela and is training as a reservist.
Campos said Venezuelans want the world to know that Venezuelans are not preparing to attack anyone and that the mission is to protect Venezuela.
In May, Chavez's government announced details in 050500 of an $18.6 million deal with a Russian firm to purchase 100000 AK-103 assault rifles with 30 rounds of ammunition each and the technology transfer for Venezuela to manufacture the rifles.
The deal works out to $186.22 per rifle.
This price is considerably less costly than the US mail-order price of $825 to $850 for the same weapon.
The Government of Venezuela also intends to buy 10 Russian helicopters, 10 Spanish transport planes, and 6 Spanish naval craft.
Venezuelan officials say the government is negotiating with Brazil to buy around 24 air support and training planes.
Chavez has insisted and even his staunchest retired military Critics here agree that the purchases are essential to update old weaponry such as the military's decades-old Belgian FAL rifles.
Retired General Fernando OCHOA ANTICH said that it is an exaggeration to say Chavez is engaged in an arms buildup.
Ochoa was defense minister in 920000 when then-Lieutenant Colonel Chavez launched a failed coup.
Ochoa stated that Venezuela hasn't purchased arms in 25 years and said and Chavez is not aggressively buying weapons in a way that would threaten his neighbors.
Ochoa said Venezuela has never bought Russian arms before and suggested Chavez is doing it to become independent from the US.
Ochoa asked why Chavez is buying a caliber of rifle which is popular among subversive forces in Latin America and stated that the political support Chavez gives to radical leftist movements makes Chavez a continental menace.
The US Pentagon has openly questioned what Chavez will do with the old FAL rifles and whether Chavez might share weapons or ammunition with guerrilla forces in Latin America.
The US government has provided no evidence of Chavez arming or funding leftist insurgencies.
Military analysts and specialists on the Colombian FARC guerrillas say the rebels have plenty of money for weapons from drug trafficking and would not be interested in old Belgian rifles or in assistance from Chavez.
A 030000 study published by the US Defense Intelligence Agency reported that more than half of the weapons seized from Colombian guerrillas from 980000 to 010000 that had markings of foreign militaries were of Venezuelan origin.
The implication was that corrupt or sympathetic members of the Venezuelan military may be aiding guerrillas.
Perhaps more distressing to Chavez's domestic opponents is the ideological training that critics say Chavez has in mind for the military and for new civilian reservists.
Chavez called earlier in 050000 for so-called Revolutionary units to start preparing the public to resist a superpower aggressor and said the first step would be to train from 100000 to 2 million volunteers in the coming years to back up active-duty armed forces.
Military analysts estimate Venezuela's active-duty armed forces number 83,000.
People's defense units would be created in neighborhoods, State companies, and the Free University established under Chavez and would report directly to the president.
The government insists the reserves will support the armed forces and not act as a fifth column against a possible anti-Chavez coup.
Espinoza said the reserves are not to be used as shock troops for any political party and that if there were a civil war, it would be up to each person to take their own side.
General Julio Ramon Quintero viloria is commander of the reserves.
Quintero said in an interview that the armed forces hope to train 50000 civilians over 20 weekends in the second half of 050000 and could train 300000 more in 060000.
Quintero said that Venezuelans don't want to be the colony of any empire and have to be ready for any possibility.
100000 reservists in 050600 engaged with the Venezuelan navy in a massive war game to repel a stronger country that had invaded.
40 employees of the state oil company participated in a similar exercise with 1200 soldiers in 050600.
Pro-Chavez circles here warn of asymmetrical warfare.
Asymmetrical warfare is a term coined by US military strategists to describe a conflict between unequal combatants where the weaker side employs guerrilla tactics.
The US government has given $3.3 billion in mostly military aid to Colombia in the past 5 years.
Chavez loyalists fear that the US government could instigate a proxy war between Colombia and Venezuela as a way to oust Chavez and control Venezuelan oil.
A senior US official in an interview dismissed the notion that the United States Government wants to invade Venezuela as complete and utter nonsense.
The official said the chavista side wishes to make the relationship negative because they've made a political calculation that Mr. Chavez reached power by constantly being in confrontation with the US.
Another development that has troubled the United States is Chavez's rollback of military cooperation and joint exercises.
The US military had a Cooperation Office for 50 years in a Venezuelan Fort.
Chavez shut it down in 040000.
5 US military trainers and students participating in an exchange program were ordered to leave the country in 050400.
Analysts say that it is likely Chavez is trying to indoctrinate his public and armed forces.
Analysts say that there is no proof that Chavez will use those forces to aid leftist revolutions elsewhere.

Police sources confirmed to the Xinhua New Agency on 020725 that all 17 arrested are still being detailed for questioning.
Hong Kong police sources were quoted as saying that the success of the operation in netting all 17 was the result of the police's effort to infiltrate into the relevant gangs here.
Police sources also intimated that more crackdowns by the Hong Kong Police on other Triad gangs will follow.
The Hong Kong police's effort in fighting organized criminals involves actively cooperating with police on the Chinese mainland and in other regions.

Peruvian military document discloses former intelligence head Montesinos' links with drug trafficking
A document signed by a former high-ranking officer of the Peruvian army and disclosed on 020725 mentions links with drug trafficking and could further compromise the situation of the former head of the National Intelligence Service of Peru Vladimiro Montesinos.
A front-page story in Peru's national daily El Comercio said Montesinos could have authorized the military leadership at Alto Huallaga to deal in drugs so as to find the leaders of the rebel group shinning path and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement.
Alto Huallaga is located northeast of the capital Lima.
The story is based on the final report of the Attorney General' s office.
The Attorney General' s Office report collected an accusatory document handed over by an unnamed Peruvian army general.
El Comercio said that in 920000 the government of then-president Alberto Fujimori put into effect the intelligence operation Scorpion to fight terrorism and drug trafficking in the Amazon region.
As part of the SCORPION plan several agents infiltrated into the groups to gather information on the main rebel and drug-trafficking commanders.
There also were additional orders for transporting cocaine as a cover for the agents.
Montesinos was a close adviser to former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori.
Fujimori resigned in 001100 over a bribery scandal and is now imprisoned in Lima for alleged connection with the scandal.

The closed Soviet-era military facility was founded in 570000 and collects and analyzes all information gathered from Russia's military spy satellites.
The space center is also involved in launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles and is working on a plan to develop defensive early warning systems.
Putin held two-hour meeting with Chirac.
