[ORG FIFA] urged [LOC South Korea] to prevent the inhumane killing of dogs . [MISC South Koreans] are angered by the international pressure on their traditional cuisine . The organizers of [MISC South Korean] website antijapan.wo.ro vowed to paralyze the websites of [ORG Warner Bros] . ( www.wpix.com ) and the [MISC French] state television network ( www.francetv.fr ) on January 19 , 2002 .

It was ahead of the [MISC World Cup] which starts May 31 , 2002 . Head of the [MISC Korean] [ORG Football Association] and a [ORG FIFA] vice president [PER Chung Mong-Joon] said [ORG FIFA] should not intervene in the eating habits of a sovereign nation . [MISC South Korean] officials said most dogs used for eating were killed instantly by electrocution . Activists contend many slaughterhouses in the countryside are not controlled . They strangle dogs , hang them by a rope and beat them in line with traditional practice to make the meat more tender . Dog restaurants were told to close or go into the backstreets when [LOC Seoul] hosted the 1988 [MISC Olympics] . No similar move is planned for the [MISC World Cup] .

[PER Rakhimov] was Vice-President of the [ORG Olympic Council of Asia] and an Executive Member of the [ORG International Amateur Boxing Association] . [PER Rakhimov] was also said to have bribed members of the [ORG International Amateur Boxing Federation] in the vote for the [ORG Federation Presidency] .

In 2001 [MISC Tajik] law-enforcement agencies and [MISC Russian] border guards seized 8.8 tons of drugs including 4.2 tons of heroin . This represented a 26 percent increase overall in 2001 with 3 times the amount of heroin . Suggestions that there are no longer drug lords in [LOC Afghanistan] and that drug traffic into [LOC Tajikistan] has been eradicated are unrealistic and false . Many years would be needed to convert [LOC Afghanistan] 's agriculture historically specialized in the growing of raw opium . Cultivation of raw opium provided the only source of income for much of the rural population . [LOC Tajikistan] 's 780-mile border with [LOC Afghanistan] is patrolled by approximately 11000 [MISC Russian] soldiers under a 1992 agreement between the [MISC Russian] and [MISC Tajik] Governments . 2002-03-01 [LOC Afghanistan] ( AF ) ; [LOC Russian Federation] ( [MISC RU] ) International ; narcotics ; terrorism [MISC Afghan] officials conducted talks with [MISC Russian] officials asking for assistance in stopping [LOC Afghanistan] 's large illegal opium and heroin trade .

But combating terrorism and drugs requires joint efforts . Peace and stability in [LOC Afghanistan] is not only in the interests of the Afghani people and nation but of all the countries in the region . [LOC Afghanistan] 's interim government stated that it would take firm measures very quickly to prevent the harvest of poppy in the wake of the [ORG Taliban] regime 's fall late last year . Leader of [LOC Afghanistan] 's interim government [PER Hamid Karzai] said the fight against poppy harvesting and the lucrative trafficking of opium and heroin will be a top priority . The anti-drug effort is strongly supported by [MISC Western] countries , whose populations are a major market for heroin and opium from [LOC Afghanistan] . February 28 , 2002 [LOC Kabul] officials announced that [MISC Afghan] police are creating their first anti-narcotics units with the help of the [ORG United Nations] due to concern that the country could again become a major producer of opium . February 28 , 2002 [PER Qanooni] stated in talks with [MISC Russian] Interior Minister [PER Boris Gryzlov] that [LOC Afghanistan] 's main task is to prevent future drugs production . [PER Qanooni] outlined a three-stage plan of action -- [MISC Afghan] authorities will seek to ban poppy harvesting . [MISC Afghan] authorities will strengthen the borders around [LOC Afghanistan] . [MISC Afghan] authorities will cooperate with the security forces of neighboring states . [LOC Afghanistan] is thought to be responsible for 75 percent of the world 's opium and 80 percent of the heroin traded illegally in [LOC Europe] . Approximately 11000 [MISC Russian] guards patrol the 1200-kilometre ( 750-mile ) border between [LOC Russia] and [LOC Afghanistan] under a 1992 agreement signed by [LOC Moscow] and [LOC Dushanbe] . The [LOC Northern Alliance] opposes the [ORG Taliban] but tolerated the harvest of poppy in territory it controlled . [LOC Afghanistan] 's interim government has been in power for 2 months . 2002-03-04 [LOC Korea] , [LOC Republic] of ( KR ) ; [LOC United States] ( [LOC US] ) International ; Government ; military [LOC South Korea] 's defense ministry under attack in parliament over allegations it is favoring [LOC U.S.] company [ORG Boeing] for multi-billion-dollar fighter project . Newspaper reports reveal that French-made plane was rated higher in air force evaluations and that the Government is instead responding to political pressure from the [LOC U.S.] and [ORG Boeing] . [LOC South Korea] 's [ORG Defense Ministry] came under attack in Parliament on 04 March 2002 over allegations that it is favoring [LOC U.S.] company [ORG Boeing] for a multi-billion-dollar fighter project . Ruling and opposition lawmakers criticized the Ministry as newspapers reported that the [MISC French-made] fighter [MISC Rafale] had scored the highest marks of any of the 4 contenders in field tests performed by [MISC South Korean] [ORG Air Force] evaluators . The 3.2 billion [LOC U.S.] dollar project to buy 40 fighters will be one of the most important international military contracts awarded this year but it has encountered multiple obstacles . Award of the contract was temporarily suspended in February 2002 after the prices offered by 4 bidders were judged too high . [LOC South Korea] 's defense ministry promised to conclude its first-stage appraisal by the end of March 2002 . There has also been much newspaper speculation that the [MISC South Korean] government might yield to [LOC U.S.] pressure to buy [ORG Boeing] 's aged [MISC F-15] k . Speculation grew in February 2002 when Defense Minister [PER Kim Dong-Shin] stressed that [LOC South Korea] should consider security ties with the [LOC United States] in the project . The other competing planes are the [ORG Dassault] firm 's [MISC Rafale] , the [ORG Eurofighter Consortium] 's typhoon 2000 and the [MISC Russian] [ORG Su-32] made by [ORG Sukhoi] . [ORG Dassault] is seeking its first foreign order for the [MISC Rafale] . [PER Kang Chang-Sung] of the opposition [ORG Grand National Party] expressed doubt of the fairness of the evaluation methods stating that his party suspects that the [ORG Defense Ministry] has political reasons to select the [MISC F-15] k . The ruling [ORG Millennium Democratic Party] also accused the Ministry of favoring the [MISC F-15] k despite the defense chief 's insistence that there was no favoritism toward [ORG Boeing] . [PER Kim] stated -- There has been no pressure from the [LOC United States] . There would be an investigation into how classified documents had been leaked . The [ORG Defense Ministry] was further pressured by numerous newspaper reports of the [ORG Air Force] 's evaluation of the [MISC Rafale] as excellent in all categories . Newspapers stated that the [MISC F-15] k was rated excellent in reliability and support combat capability but met only 30 percent of core technology requirements . Newspapers stated that the [ORG Eurofighter] was rated excellent in general function and reliability categories but the [MISC Rafale] also earned the excellent rating for its weapons and electronic warfare capability . The [MISC Su-35] placed fourth with ratings of ordinary in all five categories . [MISC Rafale] reportedly offered more generous terms for technology transfer and subcontracts for [LOC South Korea] 's aerospace industry . The Ministry stated that the air force was just 1 of 4 evaluations . Some analysts have stated that the study method is biased toward [ORG Boeing] noting that the evaluation was revised in February 2002 to ensure that all 4 bidders would receive an automatic 60 points for technology transfer . The [LOC English-language] [ORG Korea Herald] newspaper stated that this revision gives an advantage to [ORG Boeing] which has been reluctant to transfer core technology . The [ORG Korea Herald] stated that when evaluators were conducting their first-stage reports the ministry ordered them to give each bidder grades within a range of 60 to 100 points instead of 0 to 100 points . The [ORG Korea Herald] stated that critics say [ORG Boeing] would benefit most from the points minimum because it would gain fewer points than [ORG Dassault] in terms of technology transfer and subcontracts . 2002-03-29 [LOC Korea] , [LOC Republic] of ( KR ) proliferation ; international ; politics A senior [MISC South Korean] minister on Friday warned that there could be a new crisis this year over inspections of the rival [LOC North] 's nuclear program .

Unification Minister [PER Jeong] is the [MISC South Korean] government 's chief policymaker for relations with [LOC North Korea] . [PER Jeong] said in a lecture on [LOC South Korea] and [LOC US] relations with [LOC North Korea] that there was some talk in the [LOC United States] that the nuclear inspection in [LOC North Korea] should be carried out in 020800 . [LOC North Korea] 's suggestion is that the inspection should be delayed until 050000 . [PER Jeong] said that a crisis could come in 020800 on the [MISC Korean] peninsula if this issue becomes an international point of contention . Following [PER Jeong] 's comments another senior government official sought to play down [PER Jeong] 's remarks about the looming troubles . The unnamed official told the [ORG Yonhap] national news agency that talk of pressing for [ORG IAEA] inspections in 020800 had come only from private researchers in the [LOC United States] . The official said it was speculation that the [MISC North Korean] government thinks the inspections should be delayed until 050000 . Top [MISC South Korean] envoy [PER Lim Won-dong] intends to raise international concerns about the [LOC North] 's nuclear and missile programs when he goes to [LOC Pyongyang] 020403 . [PER Lim] is a special advisor to President [PER Kim Dae-jung] on national security and foreign affairs . [PER Lim] has also warned of a looming nuclear crisis on the [MISC Korean] [ORG Peninsula] . Military officials said [PER Lim] intimated the problems could be as serious as a 940000 nuclear standoff over [LOC North Korea] 's suspected nuclear weapons development that came close to conflict . The [MISC North Korean] government agreed to freeze the [MISC North Korean] nuclear program under an accord with a [MISC US-led] international consortium . The consortium is to build 2 light water nuclear reactors that produce less weapons grade fuel than [LOC North Korea] 's old graphite reactors and provide substitute fuel until they are built . The original 030000 target date for completion has been put back at least 5 years because of major political and construction delays . The 940000 Accord stipulated that the [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] ( [ORG IAEA] ) must be allowed to inspect [LOC North Korea] 's old facilities to see if plutonium has been processed before the core facilities of the new reactors are installed . 2002-04-04 [LOC India] ( [LOC IN] ) International ; military ; business [LOC India] 's [ORG Hindustan Aeronautics Limited] plans to manufacture and maintain 140 [ORG Sukhoi] 30 fighter jets for the [MISC Indian] government .

An earlier 340 million [LOC United States] dollar plan to upgrade [LOC India] 's [MISC MiG-21] fighter jets was delayed by more than 5 years . [MISC Russian] officials blamed the [MISC Indian] Government 's intransigence for the delay . The 960000 [MISC Russian] [MISC Indian] upgrade deal was meant to be completed within 2 years but the first 2 upgraded MiG-21-93 jets were not delivered to [LOC India] until 000000 . [PER N.] [PER R.

[PER Min] said it was enough to pay [LOC Myanmar] 's national debt ten times over . Drug-burning ceremonies are regular events in [LOC Myanmar] . Critics argue that it does not reflect the massive drug industry in the country . Resident Representative of the [ORG UN] 's [ORG Drug Control Program] ( [ORG UNDCP] ) [PER Jean-Luc Lemahieu] said this one is different . Almost 102 tons of poppy seeds were burnt in the capital of [LOC Myanmar] 's northern [PER Shan] state at this ceremony . The ceremony also included 249 kilograms of opium , 102 kilograms of morphine powder , three kilograms of solid morphine and various precursor chemicals . [PER Lemahieu] said that this ceremony had less processed opium and heroin than opium seeds . It made it more symbolic and indicated the willingness of those directly involved to eliminate the opium . The destruction forms part of the [ORG Central Committee] for [ORG Drug Abuse Control] 's project new destiny . It aims to prevent poppy cultivation by distributing seeds for substitution crops . Farmers have been asked to grow seven kinds of alternative crops across 21,969 acres ( 8,891 hectares ) of land instead of opium . Global narcotics authorities declared [LOC Myanmar] the world 's largest producer of opium in 2001 . They accounted for as much as 60 percent of global supply . [LOC Myanmar] beat [LOC Afghanistan] because the [ORG Taliban] militia 's enforced ban on opium poppies decreased [MISC Afghan] production by 90 percent . Critics said the [LOC Myanmar] regime overlooks much of the production and trafficking in drugs by ethnic insurgent groups . In particular the largest armed drug militia in the world the [ORG United Wa State Army] . [LOC Myanmar] 's Home Minister Colonel [PER Tin Hlaing] said the success of project new destiny is evidenced by the tons of poppy seeds that have been turned in rather than seized . [PER Hlaing] stated his confidence in the drug scourge that threatens the world will not find a place in [LOC Myanmar] if the local population is committed to this sort of cooperation . [ORG Lauk Kai] is one of the regime 's showpieces for its previous crop substitution programs . It has expanses of rubber trees , fruit orchards and paddy where poppies used to thrive . The poppies yielded the raw ingredient for heroin . [ORG Lauk Kai] is located in the infamous [MISC Golden Triangle] .

The international community is reluctant to give help . Phone [PER Kyar Shin] requested the distinguished guests to understand [LOC Myanmar] 's situation more and give practical advice and support . [ORG UNDCP] 's [PER Lemahieu] when asked by AFP what impact project New Destiny had on the international community hoped it would have a positive impact and that some additional funds would come forward . [PER Lemahieu] said so much depends on the political situation in this country . There is hope for further political change following the May 6 release of pro-democracy leader [PER Aung San Suu Kyi] from 19 months house arrest . The regime seeks the [LOC United States] approval for the project . Its global announcement comes via the regime 's newly-appointed public relations firm in [LOC Washington] .

The [MISC Russian] branch of [ORG Greenpeace] distributed a report at a press conference of [LOC Russia] 's atomic energy ministry . The ministry conceded that the [MISC Russo-Iranian] accord on the plant 's construction does not require the repatriation of the nuclear fuel . The report stated that the recycling of nuclear fuel from [LOC Bushehr] is not mentioned in the accord between the [MISC Russian] and [MISC Iranian] governments on the construction of the plant . [ORG Greenpeace] member [PER Vladimir Chuprov] said the ministry had practically admitted that [LOC Iran] will not return to [LOC Russia] the spent nuclear fuel from the power station and [LOC Russia] 's only use for [LOC Iran] is to equip itself with nuclear weapons . The atomic energy ministry confirmed the report 's existence and strongly denied [ORG Greenpeace] 's accusations . Ministry spokesman [PER Nikolai Shingarev] told AFP that [LOC Russia] would only supply nuclear fuel to [LOC Iran] on condition that it be returned to [LOC Russia] after its use . [PER Shingarev] said [LOC Russia] is currently in negotiations with [LOC Iran] . This issue will be settled before the power station comes into operation . [PER Shingarev] said the accord on [LOC Bushehr] was signed before [LOC Russia] passed a law permitting the import of nuclear waste last year . This explains why the accord makes no mention of the return of the fuel . [PER Shingarev] said it is very difficult to make a nuclear weapon from the plutonium in this fuel . The [LOC United States] and [LOC Israel] fear that the [MISC Russian-Iranian] nuclear cooperation could enable [LOC Tehran] to acquire the technology needed to build nuclear weapons . [LOC Russia] dismisses this accusation . [LOC Iran] ordered the power station in 1994 at a cost of nearly 800 million dollars ( 860 million euros ) from [LOC Russia] . [LOC Iran] has said the plant is being built only for civilian energy purposes and allows regular inspections of [LOC Bushehr] by the [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] .

[LOC Bangladesh] 's main opposition leader [PER Sheikh Hasina Wajed] said 021102 that an army crackdown on crime was turning into a political witchhunt and targeting her [ORG Awami League] party . Troops were ordered into the streets more than 2 weeks ago to eliminate rampant crime but human rights groups claim fundamental rights are being trampled . Newspapers and rights groups put the toll of those who have died in police and military custody at 16 . Officials say more than 3400 people have been taken into custody since the crackdown began 021017 . The government has confirmed the deaths of 12 people due to heart attacks . Relatives allege some suspects have been tortured in custody . The [LOC US] government and [MISC London-based] [ORG Amnesty International] have also expressed concern about the custodial deaths . [ORG Amnesty] urged a prompt and fair investigation by an independent body into the deaths . [PER Sheikh Hasina] told reporters at the airport on her return from a private trip to the [LOC United States] and [LOC Europe] that initially it appeared to be a neutral anti-crime drive and the opposition [ORG Awami League] party welcomed it . [PER Hasina] said the crackdown is gradually turning into one to eliminate the Opposition . [PER Hasina] wants the military to arrest real criminals and not violate [LOC Bangladesh] 's constitution and human rights because of concern about such violations in the name of anti-crime drive . [PER Sheikh Hasina] said the military has to operate within the laws of the land as no one is above the law . Police said the army hadon 021101 arrested former state minister and [ORG Awami League] lawmaker talukder [PER Abdul khaleque] in southwestern [LOC Khulna] city soon after he spoke at a news conference against the deployment . [ORG The] [ORG Daily Star] newspaper reported that an imam and a local leader of fundamentalist group [ORG Jamaat-e-Islami] were also arrested on 021101 in [LOC Khulna] . Former minister and [ORG Awami League] lawmaker [PER Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim] and [PER Sheikh Hasina] 's Political Secretary ex-minister [PER Saber Hossain Chowdhury] were arrested 021000 along with independent MP [PER Hemayet Ullah] aurango . [PER Selim] , [PER Chowdhury] and aurango are being detained under the strict 740000 Special Powers Act allowing detention for 120 days without charge . [PER Sheikh Hasina] questioned how 3 of the [ORG Awami League] party 's ex-ministers could be terrorists . [PER Hasina] was apparently unaware of the claims of the arrest of the [MISC Jamaat] leader when adding that it is an open secret that the [ORG Jamaat-e-Islami] and the [ORG Jamaat-e-Islami] student wing have weapons and wondering why none of the [ORG Jamaat-e-Islami] has been arrested so far . [PER Hasina] said the [ORG Awami League] party would raise the issue when parliament reconvenes 021114 . [LOC Bangladesh] 's Prime Minister [PER Khaleda Zia] 's [ORG Islamist-allied] government includes 2 cabinet ministers from the [MISC Jamaat] .

[MISC Russian] Foreign Minister [PER Igor Ivanov] and [ORG Gulf Cooperation Council] ( [ORG GCC] ) Secretary General [PER Abdel Rahman] al-Attiya held talks on 021104 . [MISC Russian] [ORG Foreign Ministry] spokesman [PER Alexander Yakovenko] said afterward that not a single [MISC Arab] country supports rebels in [LOC Chechnya] . [PER Yakovenko] said the [MISC Russian] Government finds it inadmissible to link individual States or religions with terrorism or extremism and is grateful to those [MISC Arab] states which are trying to cooperate with [MISC Russian] law enforcement agencies to cut channels for funding terrorist organizations . The [MISC Russian] government has consistently sought to portray its campaign against a separatist insurgency in [LOC Chechnya] as part of the global war on terrorism and says that rebel groups are receiving backing from the terrorist [ORG Al-Qaeda] network and from shadowy [MISC Islamic] radical groups based in countries such as [LOC Saudi Arabia] . A senior [ORG Kremlin] official said last week that the [MISC Russian] Government might ask the [ORG GCC] State [LOC Qatar] to extradite [PER Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev] . [PER Yandarbiyev] is a former [MISC Chechen] Vice-President and aide to rebel president [PER Aslan Maskhadov] . The [MISC Russian] government accuses [PER Yandarbiyev] of involvement in the 041000 hostage-taking in a [LOC Moscow] theater . [MISC Russian] government spokesman [PER Sergei Yastrzhembsky] said [LOC Qatar] 's response would demonstrate the extent of that country 's willingness to cooperate in the fight against international terrorism . [PER Yakovenko] said that stronger ties between [LOC Russia] and the [ORG GCC] States could play a special role in combating international terrorism . [PER Ivanov] said al-Attiya 's visit will contribute to increased cooperation between the [MISC Russian] government and the six [MISC Arab] monarchies of the [LOC Gulf] region . [PER Ivanov] said the [MISC Russian] government wanted to strengthen its ties with the [LOC Gulf] countries and that these ties have begun to strengthen recently . [PER Ivanovalso] said the [MISC Russian] government would like to develop them further and particularly in areas of mutual interest . The [MISC Russian] government has traditionally been close to the [MISC Arab] side in the [LOC Middle East] conflict and has spoken strongly against [LOC US] armed intervention against [LOC Iraq] in the stand-off over disarmament . [PER Yakovenko] said that [ORG Al-Attiya] 's talks with [MISC Russian] government officials 021104 and 021105 were likely to focus on oil issues and noted that both the [MISC Russian] government and the [LOC Gulf] countries are interested in stable world prices . [PER Yakovenko] said the main emphasis of the talks will be on [LOC Russia] 's possible involvement in the implementation of regional projects run by the [ORG Council] and said that there will be particular emphasis on finding peaceful , political and diplomatic ways to settle the [MISC Iraqi] issue .

[MISC Tanzanian] Vice President [PER Ali Mohamed Sheni] said on November 12 , 2002 that [LOC Africa] needs its own health forum to create research priorities to effectively combat disease on the continent . [PER Sheni] stated that [LOC Africa] will find it difficult to influence global research priorities in its favor without a forum . The continent lacks resources . [PER Sheni] attended a four-day meeting to discuss global health at [LOC Arusha] in northern [LOC Tanzania] . [PER Sheni] addressed more than 700 public health specialists from 100 countries . [PER Sheni] told delegates at the Global Forum for [ORG Health Research 's] annual meeting that less than 10 percent of the global health research budget of 70 billion dollars went to [LOC Africa] . [LOC Africa] has 90 percent of the global diseases . [PER Sheni] said the formation of the [MISC Asian] and [ORG Pacific Health Research Forum] and the [MISC Latin] [ORG American Health Research Forum] are steps in the right direction . Global Forum for [ORG Health Research] Chairman [PER Richard Feachem] said it was unfair for poor countries to be allocated meager sums of research funding . [PER Feachem] said the majority of the poor are getting little health research funding compared to the wealthy few .

A wide range of sites including a very high percentage of news sites and keywords were found to be blocked . A [LOC U.S.] study released on 03 December 2002 states that one-tenth of the [MISC Internet] 's sites may be blocked by [MISC Chinese] authorities as part of efforts to prevent access to information on dissidents , [LOC Taiwan] , [LOC Tibet] and other subjects . The study was conducted by [ORG Harvard University] 's [ORG berkman Center] for [MISC Internet] and society . The study found that more than 50000 of the approximately 200000 websites tested were inaccessible from at least 1 point in [LOC China] on at least 1 occasion . Using a more narrow definition of blocked site the study concluded that 18931 websites were being blocked to [MISC Chinese] web users . [ORG Harvard] researcher and co-author of the report [PER Ben Edelman] stated that it is likely that similar percentages apply to the [MISC Internet] as a whole . [PER Edelman] told [ORG AFP] that it is highly likely that approximately one-tenth of the [MISC Internet] is filtered by or recently has been filtered by [LOC China] . [PER Edelman] stated that there are many different ways to measure this effect and therefore hesitated to specify any single proportion . The latest study was broader than prior surveys and gives perspective to disparate reports about websites that are filtered or blocked by [LOC China] . In the report it is concluded that -- [LOC China] blocks a range of web content beyond that which is sexually explicit . 1000s of sites providing information about news , health , education , and entertainment were blocked . Approximately 3284 sites from [LOC Taiwan] were blocked . The blocked sites also included those of [LOC U.S.] news organizations including [ORG ABC News] and [ORG CBS News] , the [ORG Alta Vista] search engine , and a number of [LOC U.S.] universities . The researchers found that 100 percent of the top 10 sites with keywords [LOC Tibet] , [LOC Taiwan] [LOC China] , or equality were blocked . A large number of other sites with keywords such as freedom , democracy and [MISC HIV] were also blocked . The [ORG BBC] news site was consistently unavailable . Sites for [ORG CNN] , Time magazine , [MISC U.S.-based] public broadcasting system , the [ORG Miami Herald] , and the [ORG Philadelphia Inquirer] were also often blocked . The report found that 42 of google 's top 100 results for news were blocked . Religious sites blocked in [LOC China] included the [MISC Asian] [ORG American Baptist Church] , The atheist network , the [ORG Catholic Civil Rights League] , [PER Feng Shui] , the [ORG Jewish Federation] of [LOC Winnipeg] , and the [MISC Denver Zen] center . [LOC China] has an estimated 45 million [MISC Internet] users . [LOC China] has been widely criticized in the West for blocking websites and for imprisoning people for viewing banned sites or using the [MISC Internet] for anti-government activities . The [MISC Chinese] government is believed to routinely block a large number of foreign-based sites primarily those featuring dissident views or banned groups such as the Falungong spiritual organization but also certain foreign news sites and pages showing pornography . A recent report by the [MISC U.S.-based] [ORG Rand Corporation] think tank found that the [MISC Chinese] government now uses more technology to filter out objectionable content rather than relying solely on surveillance of users and seizure of equipment as it did in the past . The rand report released earlier in 2002 found that [MISC Chinese] authorities now appear to have more effective technology for filtering out undesirable content . 2002-12-10 [LOC Europe] ; [LOC Iraq] ( IQ ) proliferation ; international ; science A laboratory chief from the [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] ( [ORG IAEA] ) said on December 10 , 2002 that the [ORG UN] 's nuclear agency could detect even infinitesimal amounts of radiation from weapons programs if they exist in samples from [LOC Iraq] . A laboratory chief from the [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] ( [ORG IAEA] ) said on December 10 , 2002 that the [ORG UN] 's nuclear agency could detect infinitesimal amounts of radiation from weapons programs if they exist in samples from [LOC Iraq] . [PER David Donohue] spoke at the [ORG IAEA] laboratory in [LOC Seibersdorf] on the southwest outskirts of [LOC Vienna] . [PER Donohue] said the equipment can detect particles down to the picogram ( a millionth of a millionth of a gram ) . The first samples from [LOC Iraq] are due to arrive to the laboratory this week . [ORG IAEA] and other [ORG UN] inspectors have been taking soil , water and air samples since November 27 , 2001 at [MISC Iraqi] sites suspected of being used for programs to make weapons of mass destruction . [PER Donohue] said samples will be sent for corroboration to labs in [LOC France] , the [LOC US] , the [LOC UK] ( [LOC Britain] ) , [LOC Japan] and [LOC Russia] if [ORG IAEA] finds any traces of radiation from enriched uranium or plutonium , or any chemical and biological agents .

A [MISC South Korean] [ORG Foreign Ministry] official stated -- The development is regrettable and will increase tension over [LOC North Korea] 's nuclear weapons program . [LOC Japan] and the [LOC United States] should act jointly with [LOC South Korea] . The [ORG IAEA] stated that [PER ElBaradei] warned the government of [LOC North Korea] not to take further action that would prevent the [ORG IAEA] from monitoring compliance with the 1994 accord with the [LOC United States] shutting down the reactor . 20041212 [LOC North Korea] stated that the country 's plutonium-producing nuclear program would recommence in order to produce energy due to a global embargo on oil shipments . In 1994 the reactor was frozen under an accord in exchange for 500000 tons of fuel oil annually from the [LOC United States] . The accord additionally formed a consortium to build 2 light-water reactors . International experts stated that the [MISC Yongbyon] reactor was used to produce weapons-grade plutonium . After the 1994 closing approximately 8000 spent fuel rods from the reactor were sealed in metal casings in cooling ponds . 20041000 the [LOC United States] revealed that [LOC North Korea] had admitted to implementing a nuclear program based on enriched uranium , a material for nuclear weapons . 2002-12-23 [LOC Korea] , [MISC Democratic People] 's [LOC Republic] of ( [ORG KP] ) proliferation ; international ; politics [LOC North Korea] removed [ORG UN] seals at a laboratory suspected of being used to produce weapons-grade material . This activity further escalates tension in the [MISC Korean] [ORG Peninsula] 's nuclear crisis and ignores international condemnation . A source close to the [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] ( [ORG IAEA] ) said late on 021223 the [LOC North] had started stripping the [ORG UN] nuclear regulation group 's seals and monitoring equipment from the laboratory at [MISC Yongbyon] . The lab is suspected of having reprocessed fuel rods for weapons-grade plutonium before its activities were frozen under a 940000 arms control deal with the [LOC United Sates] . The source is fully informed of [ORG IAEA] activities in [LOC North Korea] and said the [LOC North Koreans] are cutting the seals of the nuclear fuel reprocessing laboratory and could complete it possibly by 021224 . The move followed similar actions 021221-021222 at the [MISC Yongbyon] nuclear facility during which the [MISC North Korean] government took control of 1000s of spent fuel rods that could be used to make nuclear weapons . The nuclear crisis dominated the first meeting between [MISC South Korean] President [PER Kim Dae-Jung] and President-elect [PER Roh Moo-hyun] earlier 021223 . [PER Kim] and [PER Roh] were meeting for the first time since [PER Roh] 's election last week and the meeting was supposed to focus on smoothing over the 030225 transfer of power between the outgoing and incoming leaders . The 90-minute talks instead centered on the [MISC North Korean] government 's latest standoff with the international community . President [PER Kim] 's spokeswoman [PER Park Sun-sook] said that [PER Kim] and [PER Roh] 's discussion was pinned down on international relations which focused on [LOC North Korea] 's nuclear issue . The [MISC South Korean] government 's frustration with the [MISC North Korean] government was evident in a foreign ministry statement which urged the [MISC North Korean] government to restore the seals and disabled monitoring cameras on the rods . The statement said that the [MISC North Korean] government took further actions to unfreeze its nuclear activities despite repeated warnings from the [MISC South Korean] government and the international community and was raising regional tension and amplifying international concerns over nuclear proliferation . The [LOC United States] responded to that development with swift condemnation . [ORG US State Department] spokesman [PER Louis Fintor] said the over 8000 spent fuel rods are of particular concern because they can be reprocessed to recover plutonium for nuclear weapons . [LOC US] Senator [PER Richard Lugar] said the [MISC North Korean] government was creating a very dangerous situation , initially for [LOC South Korea] and for [LOC Japan] but ultimately for the [LOC United States] . [PER Lugar] will head the [ORG Senate] 's [ORG Foreign Relations Committee] in 030000 . The [LOC United States] has been stepping up international pressure on the [MISC North Korean] government since 021222 . Deputy [LOC US] Ambassador [PER Evans Revere] met [MISC South Korean] Deputy Foreign Minister [PER Lee Tai-sik] in [LOC Seoul] on 021223 to discuss countermeasures to be taken against the [MISC North Korean] government following the [LOC US] and [MISC South Korean] foreign ministers' urgent talks over the phone . [MISC Japanese] Foreign Minister [PER Yoriko Kawaguchi] also expressed the widespread international alarm about the [MISC North Korean] government 's regrettable latest move . Analysts have said [LOC North Koreans] could extract some 25 kilograms ( 55 pounds ) of weapons-grade plutonium for at least 3 nuclear weapons from the irradiated rods . The [MISC North Korean] government said it unfroze its nuclear facilities because it was in a desperate energy crisis aggravated by the suspension of fuel oil shipments . The [LOC US] government said the spent plutonium has nothing to do with power generation . The [LOC United States] and [LOC North Korea] came close to war over the [MISC North Korean] government 's plutonium program in the early 1990s . The confrontation was defused when the [LOC US] and [MISC North Korean] Governments signed the 940000 agreed framework . That accord has been undermined since the [MISC North Korean] government admitted in 021000 to running a new , secret and separate program based on enriched uranium . The [LOC US] government cut its fuel aid to the [LOC North Korea] in retaliation . 2002-12-26 [LOC North Korea] ( [ORG KP] ) proliferation ; international ; politics [LOC North Korea] was criticized on December 26 , 2002 for moving to restart its long-dormant nuclear program .

The [ORG UN] atomic agency said such moves were tantamount to nuclear brinkmanship . [MISC South Korean] President [PER Kim Dae Jung] told officials that [LOC North Korea] 's shifting of unspent fuel rods into a building housing a reactor capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium aggravated an already-tense situation . [PER Kim Dae Jung] and officials assembled at an urgent national security meeting . [PER Kim Dae Jung] said that [LOC North Korea] moved to restart frozen nuclear facilities despite the international community 's efforts for a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue . This further aggravated the situation . [MISC Japanese] Prime Minister [PER Junichiro Koizumi] said the shift of the rods was proactive . Plutonium could be extracted for making nuclear warheads within months . The [LOC United States] dismissed the action as nuclear blackmail . There was strong criticism from the [ORG United Nations'] [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] ( [ORG IAEA] ) . Beginning last week [ORG IAEA] saw its monitoring equipment disabled and seals removed from the nuclear facilities that had been dormant since a 1994 accord with the [LOC United States] . [ORG IAEA] director [PER Mohamed ElBaradei] dismissed claims by [LOC North Korea] 's government that it was only acting in the wake of an energy crisis in [LOC North Korea] . [PER ElBaradei] said that the reprocessing facility at [LOC Yongbyong] is irrelevant to [LOC North Korea] 's ability to produce electricity . [LOC North Korea] has no current legitimate peaceful use for plutonium given the status of its nuclear fuel cycle . [PER ElBaradei] said restarting [LOC North Korea] 's nuclear facilities without appropriate safeguards and towards producing plutonium raises serious non-proliferation concerns is tantamount to nuclear brinkmanship . The move of 1,000 unspent rods into the reactor building is the latest action taken by the energy-starved [LOC North] since the apparent collapse of a 1994 accord that froze its nuclear capacity . The move is confirmed by both the [ORG UN] agency and the [MISC South Korean] [ORG Foreign Ministry] . The facility has the capacity for 8,000 rods . All have been stored in a cooling pond at [LOC Yongbyon] since the [LOC United States] offered [LOC North Korea] annual supplies of heavy fuel oil and two new light water nuclear reactors in return for [LOC Pyongyang] 's agreement to freeze its nuclear operations at [LOC Yongbyon] . The eight-year-old deal has fallen apart following [LOC US] revelations in October 2002 that [LOC North Korea] had admitted to running a separate nuclear program based on enriched uranium technology in violation of the accord . [LOC North Korea] is bankrupt and on the brink of economic collapse . It has been pushing for negotiations with the [LOC United States] . Experts say [LOC North Korea] needs aid and security guarantees from the [LOC United States] to ensure its survival . Throughout the nuclear dispute [LOC North Korea] has said it is ready to sit down and talk with the [LOC United States] and even to refreeze its [LOC Yongbyon] program . President [PER Kim] has been pushing the [LOC United States] to accept the offer under [PER Kim] 's sunshine policy of engagement with the [LOC North] . President [PER Kim] has criticized the [LOC United States] for previously sidelining [LOC South Korea] in handling [LOC North Korea] and said [LOC South Korea] should take a leading role . [PER Kim] was critical of the [LOC US] handling of the stand-off when eight years ago the [LOC United States] and [LOC North Korea] drew back from the brink of war over [LOC Pyongyang] 's plutonium program . The President has complained that [LOC South Korea] was sidelined during the entire dispute and ended up paying a multi-billion dollar bill for the light-water reactors . [PER Kim] 's chief security adviser [PER Yim Sung-joon] said the President instructed that [LOC North Korea] should take lead because the [MISC North Korean] nuclear issue is important to the [MISC Korean] peninsula . This was said in a statement after December 26 , 2002 's meeting . The [LOC United States] said it would stand up to nuclear blackmail and has ruled out negotiations . The [LOC US] pledged not to reward bad behavior . Experts have joined the [ORG IAEA] in dismissing the idea that [LOC North Korea] was relaunching the reactor for energy purposes . Director General for International institutions at the ministry in [LOC Seoul] [PER Chun Young-Woo] said it would produce at its peak enough for one large office building which is a negligible amount . 2002-12-26 [MISC Democratic People] 's [LOC Republic of Korea] ( [ORG KP] ) International ; Government ; technology ; energy ; weapons Experts warn that [LOC North Korea] could produce weapons-grade plutonium from spent fuel rods at re-opened nuclear reactor . Existing rods could produce 3-6 atomic bombs in 6-8 months . Experts stated that 8000 spent fuel rods reportedly stockpiled by [LOC North Korea] at a nuclear reactor the country is threatening to re-start could be used to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons . Experts stated that the rods could produce 3-6 atomic bombs in 6-8 months . The [ORG IAEA] stated that [LOC North Korea] additionally moved 1000 fresh rods into the nuclear reactor as well . The reactor could produce enough spent rods to construct 1 atomic bomb per year if reactivated . The experimental nuclear plant in [LOC Yongbyon] is a miniature of electricity-producing nuclear plants in [MISC Western] countries but operates on the same principles . The [LOC Yongbyon] plant produces 5 megawatts . Plants in [LOC France] produce 1300 megawatts . The [LOC Yongbyon] plant is 100 km north of the [MISC North Korean] capital [LOC Pyongyang] . Nuclear reactor process -- 4 meter fuel rods containing uranium oxide are burned to initiate fission -- the nucleus of the uranium atom is split , releasing neutrons that collide with other atoms , creating more neutrons in a chain reaction . Fission produces immense heat which is applied to water to create steam which drives turbines to generate electricity . Plutonium and other radioactive byproducts of the process accumulate and decrease the effectiveness of the rods until they are spent after 3-4 years . Spent rods consisting of highly radioactive plutonium and residual uranium are cooled in pools of water for several years to diminish radioactivity and then the plutonium is then recovered in nitrate form and converted into oxide . The recovered plutonium can be mixed with uranium for reuse in the reactor or used in making nuclear weapons . Nuclear experts stated that to make weapons , a high proportion of plutonium 239 ( military grade plutonium , as opposed to the commercial plutonium used in power plants ) must be extracted . 2002-12-26 [LOC United Kingdom] ( GB ) proliferation ; international ; politics [MISC British] officials are deeply concerned by a warning from the [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] ( [ORG IAEA] ) concerning [LOC North Korea] 's opening of the [LOC Yongbyon] facility and possible nuclear intentions . A [ORG UK Foreign Office] spokeswoman said Thursday that the [LOC UK] government is deeply concerned about the latest revelations in a warning by the [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] ( [ORG IAEA] ) concerning [LOC North Korea] 's possible nuclear intentions . The comments came after the [ORG IAEA] accused the [MISC North Korean] government of nuclear brinkmanship and said the [MISC North Korean] government had begun work to reactivate the [LOC Yongbyon] reactor in breach of a 940000 agreement with the [LOC United States] Government . The [ORG UK] [ORG Foreign Ministry] spokeswoman said the [LOC UK] government is in regular contact with international partners about the implications of the latest developments and is committed to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction wherever it may occur . The spokeswoman added that the [MISC North Korean] government must comply with international obligations and eliminate nuclear weapons . The [ORG IAEA] has said the [MISC North Korean] government had no current legitimate peaceful use for plutonium that could be produced at the newly reopened [LOC Yongbyon] site that is capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium . The [ORG IAEA] said the [LOC North Koreans] had moved 1000 fresh fuel rods into the [LOC Yongbyon] reactor building . Of more concern are the 8000 spent fuel rods at the facility they started unsealing 021215-021221 and the dismantling of [ORG IAEA] monitoring equipment at the site . Experts say the spent rods could be used to build 3-6 atomic bombs within 6-8 months . The [LOC United States] Government offered supplies of fuel oil and 2 new light water nuclear reactors in return for the [MISC North Korean] government 's agreement to freeze nuclear operations under the 940000 agreed framework shutting down [LOC Yongbyon] .

The deal between the [ORG ESA] and the [MISC Russian] Government could be written as early as March 2003 and signed by the [MISC Russian] government in April 2003 . The deal would allow for [MISC Soyuz] missiles to help replace phased-out Ariane-4 launchers . Ariane-4 launchers send payloads up to 2.8 tons into geostationary orbit . Spacecraft launched from [LOC Kourou] benefit from the Earth 's full rotational speed on the equator to aid their trajectory into space . With this extra momentum , the spacecraft require less fuel . Plans for the [MISC Soyuz] launches have been delayed by funding issues since modifications to be made to launch facilities in order to accommodate the [MISC Russian] rocket are predicted to cost between 250 and 300 million euro . The [MISC Russian] space program has experienced funding problems and was unwilling to contribute one third of the bill as [ORG ESA] had requested . In November 2002 the Government of [LOC France] proposed to fund the [MISC Russian] Government 's share with a loan to be paid back by profits from the launches . The [ORG ESA] stated that no financial divisions have been decided yet . [LOC France] joined [LOC Russia] in creating a joint company [ORG Starsem] in 1996 to commercialize and market the [MISC Soyuz] launches from [LOC Russia] 's [ORG Baikonur Space Center] in [LOC Kazakhstan] .

A nuclear fuel reprocessing plant about 100 kilometers ( 60 miles ) north of [LOC Tokyo] in [MISC Tokaimura] has extracted 6890 kilograms ( 15158 pounds or 7.6 short tons ) of plutonium from spent nuclear fuel since it began operating in 770000 . A [MISC Japanese] education and science ministry official said on 030128 that the total currently accounted for at the facility was 206 kg short of the plutonium initially estimated to have been produced by reprocessing spent nuclear fuel from power plants . It is known to take 5-8 kg of plutonium to produce a nuclear bomb . The official at the ministry 's nuclear safeguard office said that the case had been reported to the [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] ( [ORG IAEA] ) of the [ORG United Nations] . The finding was also reported to the [MISC Japanese] government 's [ORG Atomic Energy Commission] on 030128 . The education and [ORG scienc Ministry] denied the possibility that any plutonium had been illegally removed from the facility . The official said 94 kg of the missing plutonium is presumed to have dissolved into waste water without being measured . The official added that another 29 kg disintegrated into another type of element . The official said that plutonium may have been stuck to fuel tubes or mixed with waste water being processed to be solidified in glass and disposed of . The official also pointed to possible errors in the estimate of plutonium extracted in the process . The official said that there was a need for improvements in measuring and evaluating methods of plutonium . The report was based on inspections at the [MISC Tokaimura] facility done under [ORG IAEA] safeguard rules designed to prevent the transfer of nuclear materials for production of nuclear weapons . [MISC Tokaimura] is a [LOC Pacific Coast] complex of nuclear-related facilities and made headlines in 990000 when the world 's worst nuclear plant accident since [LOC Chernobyl] in 860000 occurred at a uranium reprocessing plant there . 3 workers set off a critical reaction in 990000 when they poured too much uranium into a precipitation tank . 2 of the 3 workers later died .

Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister [PER Aziz Pahad] stated that [LOC South Africa] is the only country in the world that has destroyed nuclear weapons . [PER Pahad] stated that the group of [MISC South African] experts will be able to assist the [MISC Iraqis] by relating its experience . The team of seven experts comprises [PER Deon Smit] , [PER Ben Steyn] , [PER Phillip Coleman] , super moloi , [PER Daan van beeck] , [PER Peter Goosen] and [PER Tom Markram] . The team would visit [LOC Iraq] in a consulting role and would not replace [ORG UN] weapons inspectors . [PER Ben Steyn] is a colonel in the [MISC South African] [ORG National Defense Force] . [PER Steyn] oversaw the end of the apartheid regime 's chemical and biological warfare program called Project Coast .

This week the [ORG UN Security Council] is debating [LOC U.S.] threats to lead a war on [LOC Iraq] after chief [ORG UN] weapons inspector [PER Hans Blix] delivered a progress report to the body on 14 February 2003 . [LOC South Africa] 's ambassador to the [ORG United Nations] [PER Dumisani Khumalo] has been calling for public sessions of the [ORG Security Council] instead of closed meetings in order to allow other countries to participate in discussions . [LOC South Africa] is the chair of both the [ORG African Union] and [ORG Non-Aligned Movement] and has been vocal in its opposition to an attack on [LOC Iraq] . [LOC South Africa] states that the [ORG UN Security Council] is the only body fit to deal with the matter . In February 2003 [MISC Nobel Peace Prize] laureate and former President [PER Nelson Mandela] stated that [LOC U.S.] President [PER George W. Bush] lacked foresight , could not think properly , and would cause a world holocaust if the [LOC U.S.] continued with plans to wage war against [LOC Iraq] . Critics have stated that despite the dire effects an [MISC Iraqi] conflict would have on the [MISC African] continent [LOC South Africa] needed to carefully assess balancing its economic relations with the [LOC United States] with its serious opposition to a [MISC U.S.-led] war . In his speech before parliament 14 February 2003 [PER Mbeki] referred to this criticism as most unfortunate stating -- Critics suggest that the [MISC South African] Government 's behavior with regard to the [LOC United States] Government should be governed by economic benefits that derive from [PER AGOA] ( [ORG African Growth and Opportunity Act] ) . The [MISC South African] government maintains very good relations with the [LOC United States] Government . Differences on any issue have never pressured the [MISC South African] Government into submitting to the [ORG United States'] views . 2003-02-20 [LOC Iran] ( [ORG IR] ) International ; Government ; energy ; weapons ; politics [MISC Iranian] opposition group accused [LOC Iran] of building banned uranium enrichment sites as part of a nuclear weapons program with goal of altering power balance in region .

[ORG U.S. Representative] for [ORG NCRI] soona samsami stated at a press conference in [LOC Washington D.C.] that [LOC Iran] 's strategy is to build weapons of mass destruction and nuclear weapons in particular in order to alter the balance of power in the region in its favor and to facilitate export of fundamentalism and terrorism . [ORG UN] [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] inspectors and its director [PER Mohamed ElBaradei] depart for [LOC Iran] 21 February 2003 to conduct an inspection at a site in [LOC Natanz] where representatives of the [ORG NCRI] have stated that the regime has concealed a test centrifuge . [ORG NCRI] showed satellite photographs of a site in [LOC Natanz] portraying a cluster of warehouses in which the group claims the regime has hidden centrifuges used to enrich uranium that could be used in nuclear weapons . [PER Samsami] stated that the clerical regime is taking advantage of the current crisis in the region and has accelerated its efforts to obtain nuclear weapons . On 09 February 2003 [MISC Iranian] President [PER Mohammed Khatami] recognized the existence of a uranium mine and extraction center but promised that the uranium would be used only for peaceful purposes . The [LOC U.S.] government was skeptical of [LOC Iran] 's intentions and stated that [LOC Iran] 's pursuit of a complete fuel cycle only made sense if it were pursuing nuclear weapons . [ORG NCRI] stated on 20 February 2003 that [LOC Iran] 's clerical rulers are also building and have tested missiles that would eventually have a range of 4000 to 6000 kilometers ( 2500 to 3700 miles ) . [ORG NCRI] stated that the information on [LOC Iran] 's weapons program had been supplied through their intelligence network within [LOC Iran] and that satellite photographs were supplied by the [ORG Institute for Science and International Security] . The [ORG Institute for Science and International Security] is a non-profit clearinghouse for security information and images . [PER Samsami] stated -- The [MISC Iranian] government had removed sensitive equipment from the [LOC Natanz] site in anticipation of the [ORG IAEA] inspection this weekend . The [MISC Iranian] government intended to bar [ORG IAEA] entry to 1 of the 5 large buildings where the centrifuge is located and would claim that it is a warehouse similar to the other 4 . [PER Samsami] provided street addresses of the suspect facilities . [PER ElBaradei] planned to conduct inspections at the [LOC Natanz] facility south of [LOC Tehran] and at the [LOC Arak] site southwest of [LOC Tehran] on 22 February 2003 and 23 February 2003 . [ORG NCRI] stated that the [LOC Arak] site produces heavy water for the production of plutonium . Plutonium is used as a trigger in nuclear weapons . [PER Samsami] stated that such weapons are a matter of survival for the regime in [LOC Iran] . [PER Samsami] stated that [LOC Iran] 's clerical regime is in a tenuous position facing unprecedented social disenchantment and expansion of popular resistance and would therefore not hesitate to use weapons of mass destruction to stabilize its position . The Government of [LOC Iran] revealed earlier this month that it had discovered uranium deposits near the central city of [LOC Yazd] and that a uranium oxide plant had been completed in the central city of [LOC Isfahan] and would be complemented by an enrichment plant now under construction near [LOC Kashan] to its north . The plant in [LOC Yazd] Province would produce concentrated yellow cake uranium while another facility at an undisclosed location would complete the cycle by producing finished fuel made entirely in [LOC Iran] . 2003-02-26 [LOC China] ( [ORG CN] ) ; [LOC Myanmar] ( [LOC MM] ) ; [LOC Thailand] ( [LOC TH] ) ; [LOC Philippines] ( PH ) ; [LOC Japan] ( JP ) ; [LOC Cambodia] ( KH ) ; [LOC Indonesia] ( [LOC ID] ) ; [LOC Vietnam] ( [LOC VN] ) ; [LOC Laos] ( [LOC LA] ) ; [LOC Malaysia] ( MY ) Narcotics ; international The [ORG International Narcotics Control Board] reported on February 26 , 2003 that illicit manufacture of methamphetamines has risen significantly in [LOC Southeast Asia] . The [ORG International Narcotics Control Board] reported on February 26 , 2003 that illicit manufacture of methamphetamines has risen significantly in [LOC Southeast Asia] . The [ORG United Nations] organ said there continues to be indications that manufacturers of heroin are increasingly shifting their attention to methamphetamine particularly in [LOC Myanmar] . The [ORG Vienna-based Board] stated that the psychotropic substance is clandestinely manufactured on a large scale along [LOC Myanmar] 's border with [LOC Thailand] and in [LOC China] and the [LOC Philippines] . Methamphetamine remains the main drug of concern in [LOC Japan] , the [LOC Philippines] and [LOC Thailand] . The [MISC Thai] health ministry has estimated that three million people regularly abuse the substance . That is five percent of the [LOC Thailand] 's population . [LOC Thailand] is the world 's largest consumer of methamphetamines . Authorities in [LOC Japan] have reported a rise in the abuse of stimulants . The [ORG Board] stated that a sharp rise in methamphetamine abuse has also been noted in [LOC Cambodia] , [LOC Indonesia] , [LOC Laos] , [LOC Malaysia] and [LOC Vietnam] . In [LOC China] there has been a rise in arrests related to the drug . The report stated that the abuse of amphetamines among children has risen sharply in [LOC Cambodia] . Law enforcement efforts apprehended amphetamines in [LOC East Asia] . The [ORG UN] organ stated that more than 70 percent of all the seizures in amphetamines made in the world took place in [LOC East] and [LOC Southeast Asia] , mainly [LOC China] and [LOC Thailand] . Most of the world manufacture of amphetamine-type stimulants has taken place in the region . The exception is [ORG MDMA] ( Ecstasy ) . The report stated production of methamphetamine poses a growing threat to other regions . Seizures of the drug have increased in [LOC Europe] and the [LOC United States] . Illicit opium poppy cultivation decreased in [LOC Laos] and [LOC Myanmar] . The [ORG Board] said that the region still witnesses massive amounts of trafficking . The region remains the second largest source of opium and heroin in the world behind [LOC Afghanistan] . The report said intravenous drug abuse has become one of the driving forces behind the [MISC HIV/AIDS] epidemic in the region . The [ORG Board] told [LOC Indonesia] , [LOC Myanmar] and the [LOC Philippines] to enforce without delaying laws passed over the last couple of years in the three countries . This referred to an issue closely related to the illicit drugs trade , namely money-laundering and was to combat the practice . The [ORG Board] voiced concern that [LOC Cambodia] and [LOC North Korea] have yet to become parties to any of the international drug control treaties . 2003-03-15 [LOC India] ( IN ) ; [LOC Pakistan] ( [LOC PK] ) War and conflict ; terrorism [MISC Kashmiri] militant groups claim responsibility for attack on [MISC Indian] police post in the disputed region that killed at least 11 people . [MISC Indian] officials claim that foreign infiltrators from [LOC Pakistan] executed the attack but local [MISC Kashmiri] groups call this baseless propaganda . On 16 March 2003 [MISC Kashmiri] militants claimed responsibility for an attack on a police post in the disputed state of [LOC Kashmir] in [LOC India] stating that they attacked to avenge the killing of their commanders by [MISC Indian] troops . The [ORG Hizbul Mujahideen] is the largest group fighting [MISC Indian] rule in the disputed [MISC Himalayan] region . A spokesman for [ORG Hizbul Mujahideen] who declined to be identified stated to AFP -- The attack was in retaliation to the recent killing of district commander [PER Amanullah] and 3 other fighters of [ORG Hizbul Mujahideen] by the [MISC Indian] army in [LOC Kashmir] . Approximately 10 to 15 fighters from [ORG Hizbul Mujahideen] , [ORG Harkatul Mujahideen] , [ORG Harkatul Jihad-e-Islami] and [PER Al Badar] attacked the camp before midnight on 15 March 2003 and into 16 March 2003 and killed at least 12 soldiers . All the fighters who participated in the operation were local [MISC Kashmiris] not infiltrators from [LOC Pakistan] as claimed by [MISC Indian] officials . The [MISC Indian] claim that cross-border incursions have increased is baseless and aimed at covering up its failures in occupied [LOC Kashmir] . The militants attacked the post in Gool in the [LOC Udhampur] district approximately 95 miles north of [LOC Indian Kashmir] 's winter capital [LOC Jammu] . At least 11 people were killed in the attack . A spokesman for another [MISC Kashmiri] separatist group called [ORG Harkatul Mujahideen] agreed with the [ORG Hizbul] official stating -- The attack was executed by local [MISC Kashmiri] fighters affiliated with 4 groups . If [LOC India] blames foreign militants it is part of its propaganda to mislead the international community . The [LOC Kashmir] region is divided between [LOC India] and [LOC Pakistan] and is claimed by both . [LOC India] and [LOC Pakistan] have fought 2 wars over [LOC Kashmir] since each gained independence from [LOC Britain] in 1947 . [LOC India] accuses [LOC Pakistan] of funding and training rebels fighting to end [MISC Indian] rule in [LOC Kashmir] . [LOC Pakistan] denies the charge .

On March 21 , 2003 a spokesman for the [LOC Central Asian] country 's defense ministry said [LOC Kazakhstan] increased its air defenses to prevent any missiles fired during the [LOC Iraq] war from threatening its [MISC Caspian] coast . The coast is a home to vital oil industry installation . Defense ministry spokesman abish smailov told AFP that incidents occur when powerful weapons such as Scud missiles are used . Smailov said that [MISC Kazakh] air space is controlled at all times using measures involving anti-missile defenses , fighter jets and anti-terrorist units . [LOC Kazakhstan] 's increased air defenses come during [LOC Kazakhstan] 's air force carries out exercises along its [MISC Caspian] shores . The shores are a center of [LOC Kazakhstan] 's nascent oil industry . [MISC Western] countries said it is inadequately defended in the event of terrorist attack . [LOC Ex-Soviet] [LOC Kazakhstan] is separated from [LOC Iraq] by a 600-kilometer ( 360-mile ) section of the [LOC Caspian Sea] and [MISC Iranian] territory . [LOC Kazakhstan] is currently cooperating with the [LOC United States] on strengthening defenses in this oil-rich area . [MISC Kazakh] politicians said that any overthrow of [MISC Iraqi] leader [PER Saddam Hussein] could reduce [MISC Western] interests in exploiting [LOC Kazakhstan] 's oil fields . Investors could turn their attention to [LOC Iraq] 's vast oil resources instead . 2003-03-30 [LOC Thailand] ( [LOC TH] ) ; [LOC Myanmar] ( [LOC MM] ) International ; narcotics The methamphetamine pills known as [ORG Yaa BAA] have surpassed heroin as [LOC Thailand] 's number one killer drug . Several million [MISC Thai] people use the drug . The methamphetamine pills known as [ORG Yaa BAA] have surpassed heroin as [LOC Thailand] 's number one killer drug . Several million [MISC Thai] people use the drug . The pill has become part of [MISC Thai] society . No other drug has become as integral in decades . The effects on the brains of its consumers is disastrous . [ORG Yaa BAA] is known as crazy medicine in [LOC Thailand] . It has been targeted in a two-month anti-drugs crackdown that has resulted in the deaths of nearly 1,900 suspected traffickers . There is much concern over the drug . The drug 's popularity increased in the mid-1990s . It has made [LOC Thailand] the world 's number one consumer . Pierre-Arnaud chouvy and [PER Joel] meissonnier state in their book [ORG Yaa BAA] recently published by the [ORG Institute of Research] on contemporary [LOC Southeast Asia] that the psychotropic drugs is used across society for both work and pleasure . Construction workers , sailors , farmers and taxi drivers take the drug to help them through long working days . Students use it to get through exam periods . Clubbers use it to help them dance all night . [ORG Yaa BAA] possesses several qualities that have helped it supplant heroin as the drug of choice in [LOC Thailand] . The book states that the drug conveys a completely positive image . It appears modern and inoffensive because it is synthetic . The energy , confidence and euphoric feeling has given users an image as a drug of happiness . The pills can also be easily consumed . They can be popped or dissolved in a glass of water , taken intravenously , pulverized and inhaled , or smoked . There are at least 90 types of the pill . [ORG Yaa BAA] is easy to manufacture and do not have any climate uncertainties like other drugs have . Instructions on how to manufacture the drug are available on the [MISC Internet] . Heroin requires opium poppy as its raw ingredient and cocaine depends on yields from the coca plant . The drug has an affordable price . It cost 60 baht ( 1.50 dollars ) per pill on the streets before [LOC Thailand] 's drug war started on February 1 , 2003 and push the price up 300 percent . The pill costs five-cents to produce . 800 million pills entered [LOC Thailand] from [LOC Myanmar] last year . The book states that the majority of the drug comes from [LOC Myanmar] particularly the areas controlled by the [LOC Wa] of the [ORG UWSA] ( [ORG United Wa State Army] ) . The book is referring to the pro-Yangon ethnic group said to operate around 50 laboratories close to the border and the mobile production units . [LOC Myanmar] could become an unrivaled regional producer because of the links between the military rulers and the [ORG UWSA] , and the jungle canopy where [ORG UWSA] operate . The military and [ORG UWSA] links result in a lack of law enforcement . The drug has become a specialty of the [LOC Golden Triangle] where [LOC Thailand] , [LOC Laos] and [LOC Myanmar] converge . Much of the world 's opium is still produced there . Chouvy and meissonnier say that methamphetamine is overtaking heroin as the production drug of choice in the area and is profiting enormously from the distribution networks that heroin trafficking has already established . Five percent of [LOC Thailand] 's population is now estimated to abuse methamphetamine . The [ORG International Narcotics Control Bureau] says the figure makes it the largest per capita consumer in the world . The drug has been around in other forms for years . It was first used in the 1920s as an antidepressant and then as a psychostimulant during [MISC World War II] and the [ORG Vietnam War] . People recruited from impoverished ethnic minorities transport the pills along a multitude of routes . [LOC Myanmar] soldiers and [MISC Thai] police and bureaucrats protect the cargo and allow them to eventually reach consumers in [LOC Thailand] . The books states that one pill will pass through seven intermediaries from the frontier runner to the retailer . The retailer will usually sell more to the drug user than he or she requires . This creates another dealer and explains the drug 's easy availability across [LOC Thailand] . Owners of boats in the southern coastal province of [LOC Ranong] and construction foremen in [LOC Bangkok] are known to force their workers to take the drug at the beginning of the workday . Occasionally in rural areas the farmers dissolve the drug in a bottle which they drink while working . Consumers are as young as seven and school has become one of the main hubs for trafficking of methamphetamine . [LOC Thailand] 's youth are the most at risk . 2003-04-03 [LOC Afghanistan] ( AF ) ; [LOC Pakistan] ( [LOC PK] ) International ; terrorism ; Government ; war and conflict [LOC Afghanistan] 's Interior Minister states that [ORG Taliban] is not capable of destabilizing the [MISC Afghan] government despite post-winter increase in attacks on government and foreign targets in the country .

On 03 April 2003 [LOC Afghanistan] 's Interior Minister [PER Ali Ahmad Jalali] stated that [ORG Taliban] and remaining al-Qaeda militants are not capable of destabilizing the [MISC Afghan] government despite their increased attacks on government and foreign targets . [PER Jalali] was speaking at his first press conference since taking office in February 2003 . [PER Jalali] stated that the arrival of spring weather was the reason for the increased number of attacks by [ORG Taliban] and remaining members of [PER Osama bin Laden] 's al-Qaeda network . The traditional fighting season in [LOC Afghanistan] is spring after the harsh winters . [PER Jalali] stated that due to the warmer spring weather terrorist activities have increased particularly in the south and southeast regions of [LOC Afghanistan] . On 02 April 2003 the [ORG U.S. State Department] stated that security in [LOC Afghanistan] was volatile and unpredictable following a series of attacks against foreigners . In a travel advisory the [ORG U.S. State Department] stated that travel in all areas of [LOC Afghanistan] including the capital [LOC Kabul] is unsafe due to military operations , land mines , banditry , armed rivalry among political and tribal groups , and the possibility of terrorist attacks including attacks using vehicular or other bombs . [ORG Taliban] and al-Qaeda militants regularly launch attacks on government and foreign targets . Last week a foreign [ORG Red Cross] worker was murdered and 2 [LOC U.S.] special forces were killed in an ambush while on patrol . [PER Jalali] stated -- On 03 April 2003 [MISC Afghan] militia forces were fighting [ORG Taliban] extremists for the 3rd day near [LOC Spin Boldak] in southern [LOC Kandahar] province near the [MISC Pakistani] border . There are approximately 50-60 terrorists in the mountains of the southern [LOC Kandahar] province and the [LOC Kandahar] security forces are conducting operations against them . On 02 April 2003 2 members of the security forces were killed and 1 was wounded . 7 of the terrorists were arrested . Several former [ORG Taliban] members were arrested in another operation in southern [LOC Ghazni] province . [PER Jalali] stated that among the former [ORG Taliban] members arrested were several well-known former [ORG Taliban] figures who were in [LOC Afghanistan] to establish a network of terrorist organizations and to conduct anti-government activities in the area . Among those arrested was former [ORG Taliban] Education Minister [PER Shaheed Kheil] . [PER Jalali] stated -- Approximately 15 suspected [ORG Taliban] members were captured in [LOC Kandahar] and 9 killed in operations launched after the 27 March 2003 murder of the [ORG Red Cross] worker . Most of the terrorist attacks are carried out by former [ORG Taliban] members based across the border in [LOC Pakistan] . These members have confessed that they were sent from [LOC Pakistan] into [LOC Afghanistan] by the former [ORG Taliban] leader . The [MISC Pakistan-based] former [ORG Taliban] members conducting the attacks were being funded by former drug smuggling operations or by supporters in [LOC Pakistan] . The militants coming across the border from [LOC Pakistan] into [LOC Afghanistan] are organized by former [ORG Taliban] elements . Funds are transferred to the [MISC Pakistan-based] former [ORG Taliban] members from [LOC Karachi] , [LOC Quetta] and [LOC Peshawar] but this does not indicate that the Government of [LOC Pakistan] is supporting the former [ORG Taliban] . It is true that the interrogated [MISC Afghan] [ORG Taliban] stated that they had come from [LOC Pakistan] and received their financial support from [LOC Karachi] and [LOC Quetta] but this does not indicate that the Government of [LOC Pakistan] is supporting them . There are many fundamentalists across the world as well as in [LOC Pakistan] and [LOC Afghanistan] . 2003-04-04 [LOC Pakistan] ( [LOC PK] ) International ; narcotics ; crime ; Government ; war and conflict ; weapons [LOC Pakistan] 's army-led [ORG Anti Narcotics Force] seize 1.22 metric tons of opium after gun battle with drug smugglers in [LOC Baluchistan] province .

The speaker told [MISC Muslims] not to allow [MISC Americans] , [MISC British] , [MISC Australians] , [MISC Norwegians] or other Western Christians to live in and benefit from the resources of [MISC Muslim] countries . [MISC Egyptian] experts said this audiotape was a genuine recording of [PER Zawahiri] 's voice and proved [PER Zawahiri] was alive and still as influential as before in al-Qaeda . [PER Montasser] al-Zayat , a lawyer who has represented [MISC Islamic] militant suspects in [LOC Egypt] , stated he was certain that the voice on the tape was that of [PER Zawahiri] , [ORG Al-Qaeda] leader [PER Osama bin Laden] 's top lieutenant . Al-Zayat stated that the recording was [PER Zawahiri] 's voice , style and manner . [PER Dia] al-Rashwan stated that he believed that the voice was [PER Zawahiri] 's and that the message bore [PER Zawahiri] 's characteristic emphasis on [MISC Islamic] militant attacks against [MISC Arab] governments which are allied to the [LOC United States] . Al-Rashwan is a journalist with [LOC Egypt] 's government daily [ORG Al-Ahram] and an expert on [MISC Islamic] militants . According to [PER Rashwan] , while bin [PER Laden] has always stressed international targets , [PER Zawahiri] has gradually shown increasing support for [MISC Arab] targets as well . [PER Rashwan] thought it was clear that [PER Zawahiri] is still second in command of al-Qaeda and that his stress on local ( [MISC Arab] ) targets was influencing not only statements and actions by [ORG Al-Qaeda] itself but also groups inspired by them . [PER Montasser] al-Zayat said that he believed bin [PER Laden] was under secure protection with [PER Zawahiri] . [LOC Zayat] thought that security conditions sometimes dictate which one speaks out . The situations and locations of [PER Zawahiri] , bin [PER Laden] and other top al-Qaeda members have been unknown since the [LOC United States] struck the bases of al-Qaeda and its [ORG Taliban] supporters in [LOC Afghanistan] in 011000 . [PER Rashwan] was unable to illuminate suspicions that [PER Seif al-Adel] , another [MISC Egyptian] , might have masterminded the triple suicide bombings that killed 34 people , including 9 bombers , in [LOC Riyadh] , [ORG Suadi Arabia] 030512 . [PER Rashwan] and other [MISC Egyptian] experts said that [PER Adel] has become [ORG Al-Qaeda] 's number 3 in command since becoming chief of military operations and succeeding [PER Abu Hafs al-Masri] . [PER Al-Masri] was killed during the war in [LOC Afghanistan] . [PER Adel] was a top member in the [MISC Egyptian] [MISC Islamic] militant movement [ORG Al-Jihad] . [ORG Al-Jihad] was led by [PER Zawahiri] and carried out many attacks in [LOC Egypt] in the 1990s . [PER Adel] left [LOC Egypt] at the end of the 1980s for a [LOC Gulf] [MISC Arab] country , then traveled to [LOC Pakistan] and then [LOC Afghanistan] , where he helped train militants at some camps , [MISC Egyptian] sources said on condition they not be named . The [MISC Egyptian] sources also said that [PER Adel] is close to both [PER Zawahiri] and bin [PER Laden] . A senior [MISC Saudi] official said 030519 that he believed [PER Adel] directed the bombings in [LOC Riyadh] . A senior [LOC United States] official stated that it was still not clear whether [PER Adel] had personally been involved . Like [PER Zawahiri] , [PER Adel] and [PER Al-Masri] were on a list of 12 most wanted suspects released by the [LOC US] administration following the 010911 attacks . At least three other [MISC Egyptians] were also on the list: Tharwat [PER Salah Shehata] , [PER Tariq Anwar] As-Sayyid [PER Ahmad] and [PER Mohammad Salah] . [MISC Egyptian] security sources said that [PER Ahmad] and [PER Salah] were killed in the war on terror launched after 010911 . [PER Ahmad] and [PER Salah] were believed to have organized suicide attacks . [PER Shehata] , a laywer , is considered by security sources in [LOC Egypt] to be responsible for [ORG Al-Qaeda] 's funding . 2003-05-15 [LOC India] ( [LOC IN] ) Narcotics ; military [MISC Indian] troops already fighting rebels in [LOC Kashmir] are now engaged in a massive campaign to destroy poppy crops in the region . Troops are facing angry farmers unaware that poppy cultivation is now punishable as a drug trafficking offense . Customs officials from the Federal [ORG Finance Ministry] launched the campaign with security forces on 15 May 2003 in the southern [LOC Kashmir] already affected by much violence . The campaign requires troops to confront angry residents desperate to earn a living and unaware they are violating the law . A similar drive was carried out in 2002 in the same region but did not stop residents from replanting . [PER Prabhakar] stated -- The crop destruction of 2002 has not served as a deterrent . The State administration has been lax on the issue . No district official has ever taken steps to destroy the crop nor even reported that poppy crops are grown in his area . Villagers in this region approximately 30 kilometers ( 18 miles ) south of [LOC Kashmir] 's summer capital [LOC Srinagar] stated that cultivating poppy crops was their only livelihood . Farmer [PER Ghulam Ahmed] stated that he and other farmers have been growing poppy crops in their fields for years with no objection from anyone . [PER Ahmed] stated that residents were shocked when officials and troops started destroying their harvest . Many villagers grow poppy for their seeds used to flavor the [MISC Kashmiri] bread known as kulcha . Bakers buy the seeds at 100 rupees ( two [LOC U.S.] dollars ) per kilogram . The lucrative byproduct is poppy SAP which can be processed into opium . [PER Rahti Begum] was disconsolate as she watched her crop being destroyed . 2003-06-24 [LOC France] ( FR ) ; [LOC Iran] ( [MISC Islamic] Republic of ) ( [ORG IR] ) International ; Government ; dissent ; crime ; terrorism ; leader A [LOC Paris] judge ordered that 11 members of [MISC Iranian] armed opposition group the [ORG People 's Mujahedeen] remain imprisoned .

On 22 June 2003 17 members of the [ORG People 's Mujahedeen] were placed under judicial investigation . The 17 members included [PER Rajavi] . The investigation is the first step toward formal criminal charges for alleged links between the [ORG People 's Mujahedeen] and a terrorist organization and for funding terrorist activity . Last week [MISC French] police raided more than a dozen locations linked to the [ORG People 's Mujahedeen] northwest of [LOC Paris] . [LOC Paris] officials have accused the [ORG People 's Mujahedeen] of using [LOC France] as a rear base to plan attacks against [MISC Iranian] interests .

[LOC Wi] [MISC Sung-lac] stated that [LOC Japan] seems to have taken a similar position to [LOC south Korea] and that there seems to be no determined policy despite various opinions in the [LOC United States] . [LOC Wi] [MISC Sung-lac] refused to give any details about the [MISC North Korean] nuclear reactor project . The [ORG Yonhap News Agency] stated that [PER Charles Kartman] would reaffirm that the [MISC North Korean] nuclear reactor project may not be completed if the [MISC North Korean] government continued to pursue a nuclear agenda . The [LOC United States] Government has reportedly suggested the [MISC North Korean] nuclear reactor project be halted as part of growing diplomatic pressure on the [MISC South Korean] government . [LOC South Korea] has so far taken a cautious stance on the issue of the [MISC North Korean] nuclear reactor project . The [ORG Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization] was created under a 940000 Agreed Framework between [LOC North Korea] and the [LOC United States] . The [ORG Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization] was to provide [LOC North Korea] with 2 light-water nuclear reactors deemed unsuitable for weapons production and 500000 metric tons of heavy fuel oil per year . Construction on the 2 light-water nuclear reactors started in 020800 and is already behind schedule . Construction on 1 of the 2 light-water nuclear reactors was originally planned to be completed in 030000 . The [ORG Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization] has maintained construction work on the 2 light-water nuclear reactors and has suspended shipments of fuel oil to [LOC North Korea] from 021200 at the height of the nuclear stand-off which intensified in 021000 when the [MISC North Korean] government admitted to running a nuclear weapons program based on enriched uranium . The 940000 Agreed Framework between [LOC North Korea] and the [LOC United States] required [LOC North Korea] to stop the use of graphite-moderate reactors used to produce weapons-grade plutonium at [LOC North Korea] 's [LOC Yongbyon] nuclear plant . [LOC North Korea] did not adhere to the 940000 agreed framework . [LOC North Korea] unsealed spent fuel rods from the graphite-moderate reactors , removed [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] inspectors and withdrew from a nuclear non-proliferation treaty . On 030609 [LOC North Korea] admitted publicly for the first time that [LOC North Korea] was seeking nuclear weapons capability . [LOC United States] officials do not know how far [LOC North Korea] 's nuclear weapons program has progressed . [LOC United States] officials believe the [MISC North Korean] government has already stockpiled enough plutonium for 1 or 2 nuclear weapons . [LOC North Korea] and the [LOC United States] sat down for their first talks in three-way negotiations with [LOC China] in 030400 but no further meetings have been scheduled . [LOC United States] government is seeking support from its allies to cut [LOC North Korea] 's alleged funding from the sales of arms , illegal drugs and currency counterfeiting .

[MISC Chinese] deputy foreign minister was dispatched to [LOC North Korea] to meet with [PER Kim Jong-Il] in an attempt to deescalate the situation . [MISC Chinese] diplomats were quoted in the [ORG Asian Wall Street Journal] on 18 July 2003 as stating that [LOC China] believes [LOC North Korea] currently has enough plutonium to build a nuclear bomb . This belief caused the Government of [LOC China] to accelerate diplomacy to resolve the crisis and to dispatch [MISC Chinese] Deputy Foreign Minister [PER Dai Bingguo] to [LOC Pyongyang] , [LOC North Korea] on 12 July 2003 in this effort . [LOC China] is [LOC North Korea] 's closest ally . [LOC North Korea] is a Stalinist regime . [PER Dai] is presently in [LOC Washington D.C.] to inform top [LOC U.S.] policymakers of the outcome of the rare meeting with [MISC North Korean] leader [PER Kim Jong-Il] . The newspaper stated that in recent weeks [MISC Chinese] intelligence services concluded that [LOC North Korea] is producing weapons-grade plutonium in sufficient quantities and possesses all the necessary components to assemble nuclear-tipped missiles . A [MISC European] official familiar with internal [MISC Chinese] reports on the findings and [MISC Chinese] diplomats were quoted in the newspaper as stating that the reprocessed plutonium is estimated to be sufficient to make at least 1 nuclear device . The [MISC European] official stated that [LOC North Korea] has yet to combine the plutonium , triggering devices and other components into a bomb . The [MISC Chinese] reports in part verify recent claims made by the Government of [LOC North Korea] that a number of spent nuclear fuel rods sealed in 1994 have been opened and have undergone reprocessing ostensibly to produce plutonium . Until now [LOC China] had stated that no evidence existed that [LOC North Korea] was seeking nuclear weapons . The [LOC U.S.] government has been unable to confirm the [MISC North Korean] government 's claims . [LOC U.S.] and [MISC South Korean] officials have speculated that [LOC North Korea] may have 1 or 2 nuclear bombs and may have the capacity to build 6 . The [MISC Chinese] government 's increasing concern was made evident by the new urgency of its diplomacy this week . At a foreign ministry briefing on 17 July 2003 spokesman [PER Kong Quan] stated that the [MISC North Korean] crisis was at a critical point . [PER Kong Quan] stated that [LOC China] is attempting to deescalate the situation by promoting talks and encouraging the 2 parties to make peace . [PER Kong Quan] stated that it is important that the parties return to negotiations and continue with the trilateral talks that commenced in April 2003 . The trilateral talks of April ended poorly with the [MISC North Korean] government stating it possessed and might test nuclear weapons . According to [LOC U.S.] officials there is now a greater possibility that new talks could occur as [LOC North Korea] appears willing to join another negotiating session with [LOC China] and the [LOC United States] . There were also indications that the dialogue could be expanded to include [LOC Japan] and [LOC South Korea] . [MISC South Korean] officials have been quoted as saying that a dialogue could take place as early as August 2003 . The [LOC United States] government has always insisted on multilateral talks and has been eager to include its [MISC Japanese] and [MISC South Korean] allies . [LOC North Korea] has consistently demanded 1-on-1 talks with the [LOC U.S.] government . The Government of [LOC China] emphasizes that it is more important to resume talks quickly than to refrain until the number of participants can be agreed upon . [LOC China] is a traditional ally and supplier of food and fuel to [LOC North Korea] [LOC China] and is therefore the country with the most leverage over [LOC North Korea] . [LOC China] has demonstrated that it is willing to take advantage of this leverage . Earlier in the crisis [LOC China] stopped oil supplies to [LOC North Korea] for several days . 2 days after [MISC North Korean] leader [PER Kim Jong-Il] granted [PER Dai] the rare meeting for 14 July 2003 the regime 's [ORG Korean Central News Agency] announced that [LOC China] had recently decided to donate 10000 tons of diesel oil to [LOC North Korea] . 2003-07-20 [LOC Thailand] ( [LOC TH] ) ; [LOC China] ( [ORG CN] ) ; [ORG Lao People 's Democratic Republic] ( [LOC LA] ) ; [LOC India] ( IN ) ; [LOC Myanmar] ( [LOC MM] ) Narcotics ; international ; politics [LOC Thailand] will host ministers from [LOC China] , [LOC Laos] , [LOC India] and [LOC Myanmar] to discuss the elimination of precursor chemicals used in drug production .

The meeting will take place from 22 July 2003 - 25 July 2003 in one of the corners of the [LOC Golden Triangle] and is the first of its kind . The meeting will be attended by the ministers responsible for drug suppression in [LOC China] , [LOC Laos] , [LOC India] , [LOC Myanmar] and [LOC Thailand] . [MISC Thai] Justice Minister pongthep [PER Thepkanjana] will host the meeting . Deputy chief of [LOC Thailand] 's office of [ORG Narcotics Control Board] ( [ORG ONCB] ) rasanee Vistaveth stated the ministers from [LOC China] , [LOC Laos] , [LOC India] , [LOC Myanmar] and [LOC Thailand] are expected to adopt the [LOC Chiang] [MISC Rai Declaration] which will touch on the countries' commitment to solving the problem of drugs , particularly with regard to precursors and chemical trafficking . Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are contained in legal medicines and are used to produce illegal stimulants including speed or ice which are produced in large quantities in [LOC Myanmar] and then trafficked to [LOC Thailand] and [LOC China] and beyond . Chemical precursors are also used to turn raw opium into heroin . [PER Rasanee] stated the ministers from [LOC China] , [LOC Laos] , [LOC India] , [LOC Myanmar] and [LOC Thailand] expect to openly discuss their countries' weak points and the measures each country is taking to control these substances and prevent the substances from reaching the [LOC Golden Triangle] area . [PER Rasanee] said the governments of [LOC China] , [LOC Laos] , [LOC India] , [LOC Myanmar] and [LOC Thailand] will explore ways to cooperate to intercept the illegal substances which are also used in legitimate industries . [PER Rasanee] stated every country has its own way of controlling precursors but as matter of fact many precursors still flood the [LOC Golden Triangle] area . The ministers from [LOC China] , [LOC Laos] , [LOC India] , [LOC Myanmar] and [LOC Thailand] will also address crop substitution initiatives for impoverished ethnic minorities who still rely on opium cultivation . [PER Rasanee] referred to [LOC Thailand] 's successful decades-long campaign to eliminate poppy growing from its territory and reported that [LOC Thailand] is willing to help and share its own expertise on opium elimination by training officials . The ministers from [LOC China] , [LOC Laos] , [LOC India] , [LOC Myanmar] and [LOC Thailand] will discuss how to find markets for goods produced under crop substitution and other related programs such as eco-tourism and handicraft manufacturing . 2003-08-03 [LOC Iran] , [LOC Islamic Republic] of ( [ORG IR] ) International ; media ; weapons ; technology ; science ; government [LOC La] times probe finds strong evidence that [LOC Iran] appears to be in the late stages of developing the capacity to build a nuclear bomb . The [ORG Los Angeles Times] in the 030804 edition Summarized results of an independent probe which strongly indicated that [LOC Iran] is striving to become the world 's next nuclear power and appears to be in the late stages of developing the capacity to build a nuclear bomb . The [ORG Los Angeles Times] said the 3-month investigation drew on previously secret reports , international officials , independent experts , [MISC Iranian] exiles and intelligence sources and uncovered strong evidence that [LOC Iran] 's commercial program masked a military undertaking . [ORG The Times] report said that scientists from [LOC Russia] , [LOC China] , [LOC North Korea] and [LOC Pakistan] plus advancing technology have propelled [LOC Iran] 's nuclear program much closer to producing a bomb than [LOC Iraq] ever was . [ORG The Times] pointed out that some experts predict [LOC Iran] might produce an initial atomic weapon in the next 2-3 years . No one is certain about the actual time frame for [LOC Iran] 's nuclear weapon production . Nuclear materials: [ORG The Times] said a confidential report prepared by the [MISC French] Government in 030500 concluded that [LOC Iran] is surprisingly close to having enriched uranium or plutonium for a bomb . A foreign intelligence service provided a copy of the report to the times . The [MISC French] government warned other governments in the report to exercise the most serious vigilance on their exports to [LOC Iran] and [MISC Iranian] front companies . [ORG The Times] report said that samples of uranium taken by [ORG UN] inspectors in [LOC Iran] in 030600 tested positive for enrichment levels high enough to be consistent with an attempt to build a nuclear weapon . The [MISC Iranian] government also secretly imported 1.8 tons of nuclear material from [LOC China] in 910000 and processed some of this nuclear material in order to manufacture uranium metal . This uranium would be of no use in [LOC Iran] 's commercial program but would be integral to weapons production . foreign scientists' involvement: [ORG The Times] quoted an unnamed [MISC Middle Eastern] intelligence official that [LOC Pakistan] 's role was bigger than thought from the beginning . [PER Abdul Qadeer Khan] has helped [LOC Iran] for years and is a [MISC Pakistani] nuclear scientist regarded by the [LOC United States] as a purveyor of nuclear secrets . [ORG The Times] said people inside [LOC Iran] and foreign intelligence officials say that [MISC North Korean] military scientists had been recently monitored entering [MISC Iranian] nuclear facilities and are assisting in the design of a nuclear warhead . There is a resort on the [MISC Caspian] coast set aside for the exclusive use of [LOC North Koreans] who are working on nuclear and missile projects in [LOC Iran] . This indicates the number of [LOC North Koreans] working in [LOC Iran] on such projects . [MISC Russian] scientists sometimes travel to [LOC Iran] under false identities and work without the [MISC Russian] government 's approval to help complete a special reactor that could produce weapons-grade plutonium . New technology: The report said [MISC Iranians] have also approached [MISC European] companies in recent months to buy devices that can manipulate large volumes of radioactive material . This technology is for forging uranium metal and plutonium and switches that could trigger a nuclear weapon . [MISC European] intelligence sources said list of items the [MISC Iranians] have wished to procure was a strong indication that [LOC Iran] has moved to the late stages of weapons development . 2003-11-29 [LOC Iran] ( [ORG IR] ) International ; proliferation [LOC Iran] pledges to provide nuclear information to [ORG IAEA] and sign nuclear protocol before 20040200 but not to indefinitely suspend uranium enrichment 20031129 Secretary of [LOC Iran] 's [ORG Supreme National Security Council] and senior [MISC Iranian] nuclear official [PER Hassan Rowhani] stated -- By 20040200 when director general of the [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency] of the [ORG UN] [PER Mohammed El-Baradei] presents a new report [LOC Iran] will provide all required information and means of verification to the [ORG IAEA] . The [MISC Iranian] government will soon authorize its representative to the [ORG IAEA] to sign the additional protocol to the [ORG Non-Proliferation Treaty] . 20031126 the [ORG IAEA] passed a resolution condemning [LOC Iran] for 18 years of covert nuclear activities . The resolution contained a passage warning that any further non-proliferation breaches by [LOC Iran] would occasion stern action . The [LOC US] demanded that the [MISC Iranian] government be brought before the [ORG UN Security Council] for possible sanctions while [LOC Britain] , [LOC France] and [LOC Germany] demanded that [LOC Iran] be rewarded for cooperating with the [ORG IAEA] since 20031000 but neither demand was met by the resolution . Prior to 20031129 [PER Rowhani] had made no statement after the 20031126 [ORG IAEA] resolution . [PER Rowhani] stated -- The suspension of uranium enrichment is provisional and voluntary and intended to build confidence . [LOC Iran] continues to refuse to indefinitely suspend its uranium enrichment activities and reserves the right to recommence enrichment at any moment . [LOC Iran] 's uranium enrichment has prompted international concern that [LOC Iran] may be capable of constructing an atomic bomb . [LOC Iran] stated that the purpose its nuclear activities is peaceful . [PER Rowhani] stated that [LOC Iran] wants to use enriched uranium to supply fuel for a future civil center . [PER Rowhani] stated that the [MISC Iranian] government will discuss with [MISC European] governments the transfer of modern technology , nuclear technology and fuel to [LOC Iran] . An unprecedented mission by the foreign ministers of [LOC Britain] , [LOC France] and [LOC Germany] in 20031000 convinced the [MISC Iranian] government to -- Declare the entirety of the country 's nuclear activities . Suspend uranium enrichment . Sign the NPT additional protocol allowing stricter inspections of [MISC Iranian] nuclear facilities . 2003-12-02 [LOC China] ( [ORG CN] ) ; [LOC Germany] ( [LOC DE] ) technology ; international ; business ; environment [MISC German] technology group [ORG Siemens] stated that negotiations had begun between [ORG Siemens] and [LOC China] to export an unused plutonium-processing facility to [LOC China] . On 031202 a [MISC German] technology group named [ORG Siemens] stated that delicate negotiations had begun between [ORG Siemens] and [LOC China] to export an unused plutonium-processing facility to [LOC China] and that the negotiations had support from Chancellor [PER Gerhard Schroeder] . [PER Gerhard Schroeder] is currently visiting [LOC China] . News of the potential sale of the plutonium-processing facility came after [PER Gerhard Schroeder] met on 031201 with [MISC Chinese] Premier [PER Wen Jiabao] . [MISC German] government sources stated that [PER Wen Jiabao] expressed interest in the plutonium-processing facility during the 031201 meeting with [PER Gerhard Schroeder] and that [PER Gerhard Schroeder] then promised to study [PER Wen Jiabao] 's request to purchase the plutonium-processing facility . [PER Gerhard Schroeder] is on day 2 of a 3 day visit to [LOC China] . [PER Gerhard Schroeder] has visited [LOC China] 5 times since 990000 and has focused the visits on boosting economic relations . [PER Gerhard Schroeder] is accompanied by a strong business delegation including [ORG Siemens] boss [PER Heinrich von Pierer] . Any sale of plutonium-processing facility between [LOC China] and [ORG Siemens] is likely to be highly politically contentious and would need the approval of [PER Gerhard Schroeder] 's centre-left ruling coalition . [PER Gerhard Schroeder] 's centre-left ruling coalition includes the environmentalist [ORG Greens] . A previous proposal to export the plutonium-processing facility to [LOC Russia] collapsed in 010000 amid political concerns . The political concerns were voiced by the [ORG Greens] and others . A [ORG Siemens] spokesman in [LOC Germany] stated that [PER Heinrich von Pierer] stated that [ORG Siemens] was beginning talks with interested [MISC Chinese] parties about a sale of the plutonium-processing facility . A [ORG Siemens] spokesman in [LOC Germany] stated that [PER Heinrich von Pierer] stated that [PER Gerhard Schroeder] stated that [PER Gerhard Schroeder] is not against the sale of the plutonium-processing facility in principle . A [ORG Siemens] spokesman in [LOC Germany] stated to the [ORG Agence France-Presse] that [ORG Siemens] was confident about the outcome of the talks to sell the plutonium-processing facility . A [ORG Siemens] spokesman in [LOC Germany] refrained from commenting on the political aspect of the sale of the plutonium-processing facility . A [ORG Siemens] spokesman in [LOC Germany] stated that export permission would be needed from the [MISC German] Government and that the speed of any sale of the plutonium-processing facility would be contingent upon obtaining the correct political support . A [MISC Chinese] delegation has already inspected the plutonium-processing facility at [LOC Hanau] in western [LOC Germany] and [ORG Siemens] has lodged an application for an export licence . A spokeswoman for [LOC Germany] 's Federal exports office confirmed [ORG Siemens] 's application for an export licence had been lodged with [LOC Germany] 's Federal exports office . A spokeswoman for [LOC Germany] 's Federal exports office stated to [ORG Agence France-Presse] that the application for an export licence was being studied at ministerial level due to the political considerations involved . The political aspect of the sale of the plutonium-processing facility will be difficult to negotiate . The plutonium-processing facility is described as [LOC Europe] 's largest plutonium plant producing fuel for nuclear reactors and was completed in 910000 at a cost of 700 million euros . The plutonium-processing facility never went into operation and was abandoned in 950000 . The [LOC Hanau] plutonium-processing facility was abandoned after safety concerns . [ORG Siemens] stated that the [LOC Hanau] plutonium-processing facility was also abandoned due to political difficulties at a time of growing debate about the future of nuclear power . The Environment Minister of [LOC Hesse] state was the [ORG Greens] member [PER Joschka Fischer] who is now [LOC Germany] 's Foreign Minister . [LOC Hesse] state includes [LOC Hanau] where the plutonium-processing facility is located . The plutonium-processing facility is estimated to be worth about 50 million euros on 031202 . [ORG Siemens] would not comment on the plutonium-processing facility 's estimated value of 50 million euros . The environmental group [ORG Greenpeace] urged the [MISC German] Government to refuse the sale of the plutonium-processing facility . [ORG Greenpeace] stated that any sale of the plutonium-processing facility would effectively mark a [MISC German] contribution to political destabilisation in the [LOC Far East] . [ORG Greenpeace] stated that the fuel of the plutonium-processing facility could be refined to extract weapons-grade material and that the plutonium-processing facility should be scrapped . 2003-12-04 [LOC Germany] ( [LOC DE] ) ; [LOC China] ( [ORG CN] ) International ; technology ; energy ; Government ; business ; environment A [MISC Chinese] company has discussed buying a plutonium factory from a [MISC German] technology group . [MISC German] Defence Minister [PER Peter Struck] stated that [LOC Germany] will export a plutonium facility to [LOC China] only if [LOC China] guarantees to use it only for peaceful purposes . 4 December 2003 [MISC German] Defense Minister [PER Peter Struck] stated that [LOC Germany] will export a plutonium facility to [LOC China] only if [LOC China] guarantees to use it only for peaceful purposes . The export is controversial . [PER Struck] spoke in an interview to the [ORG Neue Presse] daily . The ruling centre-left coalition has criticized the proposed sale of the plutonium facility . [MISC German] Chancellor [PER Gerhard Schroeder] stated earlier this week he will investigate [LOC China] 's request to buy the plutonium facility . [PER Schroeder] recently visited [LOC China] . [PER Struck] stated -- [PER Schroeder] is correct to promise to examine the proposed exportation . [LOC China] must guarantee that the plutonium factory will not be used for military purposes but to produce atomic energy . The sale is a highly emotional subject . [PER Struck] is confident the coalition will settle its disagreements . If [LOC China] makes the guarantee struck will not be concerned about the sale of the facility . Earlier on 4 December 2003 [MISC Chinese] [ORG Foreign Ministry] spokesman [PER Liu Jianchao] stated -- A [MISC Chinese] company discussed a possible sale of the facility with owner [MISC German] technology group [ORG Siemens] . The facility would be used for civil purposes and has no military goal . The facility would have nothing to do with non-proliferation issues . The facility was completed in 1991 . The facility would have been [LOC Europe] 's largest plant producing fuel for atomic power stations . The facility never went into operation . In 1995 the facility was abandoned under pressure from environmentalist party the [ORG Greens] . The [ORG Greens] party is now junior partner in [PER Schroeder] 's coalition . Senior green members such as co-leader [PER Angelika Beer] demand the sale to [LOC China] be refused . [LOC Germany] is phasing out atomic energy for environmental reasons and senior green members state that it would be hypocritical of [LOC Germany] to export an atomic energy facility . According to press reports [ORG Greens] Foreign Minister [PER Joschka Fischer] has agreed to a sale . Some members of of [PER Schroeder] 's Social [ORG Democrat Party] protest the sale . [PER Schroeder] has publicly expressed his support of the sale . The plutonium facility is located in [LOC Hanau] , western [LOC Germany] . [PER Joschka Fischer] is the [MISC Greens'] most charismatic figure . 2003-12-09 [LOC Brazil] ( [ORG BR] ) International ; crime ; Government ; politics ; weapons [LOC Brazil] 's [ORG Senate] approves legislation increasing firearm purchase age and proposing a 2005 referendum on the banning of gun sales . 20031209 77 of 81 members of the [MISC Brazilian] [ORG Senate] approved restrictions on the sale of firearms and enhanced sentences for those found guilty of trafficking illegal guns . The legislation increases minimum age for purchasing a firearm from 21 to 25 and proposes a referendum on the ban of firearm sales in 20051000 . The lower chamber of deputies has already passed the bill . The legislation must be signed into law by President [PER Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva] to take effect . Senator [PER Cesar Borges] of the liberal [ORG Front] party sponsored the bill and stated that the reduction of [LOC Brazil] 's 50000 annual gun deaths would be a momentous achievement . [LOC Brazil] has one of the world 's highest rates of gun-related murders . 2003-12-16 [LOC Yemen] ( Ye ) terrorism ; international [ORG Al-Qaeda] officer [PER Mohammed Hamdi] al-Ahdal reveals under interrogation that [MISC Saudis] and [MISC Yemenis] were involved in funding two terrorist attacks in [LOC Yemen] . Sources close to the investigation said on 031216 that al-Qaeda officer [PER Mohammed Hamdi] al-Ahdal has revealed under interrogation that unnamed [MISC Saudis] and [MISC Yemenis] were involved in funding two terrorist attacks in [LOC Yemen] . Saudi-born adhal 's alias is [PER Abu Issam] al-Maki and was [ORG al-Qaeda] 's leader in [LOC Yemen] . Ahdal was arrested 031100 . Ahdal revealed that the financing of the attacks against the [PER USS Cole] in 001000 and the [MISC French] supertanker [ORG Limburg] in 021000 October and other terrorist attacks went through Ahdal and originated from [MISC Saudis] and [MISC Yemenis] residing outside . Ahdal told investigators the money came in installments and in small quantities in order to avoid detection . Ahdal told the investigators all the financial and technical preparations for the attacks of both the [PER USS Cole] and [ORG Limburg] were supervised by Ahdal and revealed that one of the two suicide bombers in the [PER USS Cole] attack carried the family name of [MISC Al-thore] . The [MISC Saudi-owned] [PER Al-majala] weekly magazine 's current edition said that [MISC Saudis] and [MISC Yemenis] were implicated in the terrorist attacks in [LOC Yemen] . [PER Al-majala] said the Government of [LOC Yemen] informed [MISC Saudi] authorities of information revealed by Ahdal under investigation reagrding [MISC Saudi] persons involved in the funding and that [MISC Yemeni] authorities are preparing to receive [MISC Saudi] officers in joining the investigation . [PER Al-majala] said [MISC Yemeni] authorities refused a [MISC Saudi] request asking for Ahdal to be extradited for interrogation in [LOC Saudi Arabia] because the [MISC Yemeni] [ORG Constitution] disallows the handing over of [MISC Yemeni] citizens regardless of any charges . A [MISC Saudi] team of investigators is currently in [LOC Yemen] . [MISC Yemeni] authorities believe Ahdal is the second-in-command to [PER Ali Qaed] Sunian al-Harithi . [PER Ali Qaed] Sunian al-Harithi 's alias was [PER Abu Ali al-Harithi] . [ORG Harithi] was among the six al-Qaeda suspects killed in November 021100 in a missile attack by the [ORG US Central Intelligence Agency] in the desert region of [MISC Al-Naqaa] east of [LOC Sanaa] in [LOC Marib] province . [LOC Yemen] is the ancestral homeland of al-Qaeda leader [PER Osama bin Laden] and has been under pressure from the [LOC US] government since the 010911 attacks on the [LOC US] to crack down on presumed [ORG Al-Qaeda] militants . 2004-02-03 [LOC Vietnam] ( [LOC VN] ) ; [LOC China] ( [ORG CN] ) ; [LOC Cambodia] ( KH ) ; [LOC Taiwan] ( TW ) ; [LOC India] ( IN ) ; [LOC Hong Kong] ( [LOC HK] ) International ; crime ; health Live poultry smuggling undermines [ORG WHO] and [ORG FAO] efforts to restrict bird flu spread in [LOC Asia] . [ORG FAO] and [ORG WHO] advise countries to tighten border security . Smugglers are undermining international efforts headed by the [ORG UN World Health Organization] ( [ORG WHO] ) and [ORG Agricultural Organization] ( [ORG FAO] ) to eradicate bird flu by trafficking illegal live poultry that threaten to spread the disease to new areas . Attempts to halt bird flu spread -- Agriculture and customs officials have increased border checks throughout the affected region to halt illicit trade . Recent arrests of live poultry smugglers have occurred at checkpoints . Most affected [MISC Asian] countries have banned the import and export of live and slaughtered poultry to prevent the movement of potentially infected chickens and ducks across borders . Senior [ORG FAO] Animal Production and Health Officer in [LOC Asia] [PER Hans Wagner] stated -- The [ORG FAO] is concerned and well aware that there is copious uncontrolled movement of animals between borders in some [MISC Asian] countries . Smuggling occurs chiefly across the Green or uncontrolled borders of [LOC Vietnam] , [LOC Laos] , [LOC Thailand] , [LOC Cambodia] , [LOC Myanmar] and [LOC China] is likely a source for spreading the flu and other diseases . Authorities in [LOC Vietnam] stated that smuggling of meat and fruit from [LOC China] has increased drastically in the past year . [LOC Vietnam] has experienced 9 flu fatalities and is the country worst affected by the disease . Preventing smuggling from [LOC Vietnam] is difficult because the country 's extensive land borders with [LOC China] , [LOC Laos] and [LOC Cambodia] are poorly controlled by a notoriously corrupt customs department . Most nations have tightened border controls in accordance with [ORG FAO] and [ORG WHO] advisories . 20040120 [MISC Cambodian] authorities detained 10 in the southern province of [LOC Ta KEO] for importing over 150000 duck eggs from [LOC Vietnam] . [LOC Cambodia] has continuously been combating chicken and egg smuggling from [LOC Vietnam] and is on high alert . 20040202 [LOC Taiwan] tightened security against smugglers following the discovery in 20031200 of H5N1 in ducks smuggled from mainland [LOC China] . [LOC Taiwan] has previously successfully controlled an outbreak of the milder [MISC H5N2] flu strain . [MISC Taiwanese] coastguards increased patrols around the island and several island groups off the [MISC Chinese] mainland . Approximately 8000 poultry and pig farmers were vaccinated against human flu to prevent it mutating with bird flu strains . [LOC India] is free of the disease but has deployed hundreds of soldiers to the border with [LOC Myanmar] . [LOC Myanmar] has no reported H5N1 cases but [MISC Indian] officials suspect that poultry could be smuggled through [LOC Myanmar] from [LOC Thailand] . [LOC Thailand] is one of the countries worst affected by the virus . [LOC Hong Kong] authorities have increased security along the border with [LOC China] . The Government stated that illegally slaughtered poultry imports increased by 15 percent from 2002 to 2003 . The Customs and [ORG Excise Department] reportedly seized 29266 kilograms of chilled or frozen poultry in 2003 compared with 1749 kilograms in 2002 . Customs spokesman [PER Richard] law stated that the Department performs frequent checks on smuggling activities and have now increased efforts to inspect cargoes . The H5N1 flu strain has caused 13 deaths and reported outbreaks in 10 countries . 2004-02-09 [LOC China] ( [ORG CN] ) International ; Government ; technology ; business [ORG Volkswagen AG] rejects a [MISC Chinese] newspaper report that it had put a stop to technology transfers of its [PER Santana] sedans to joint venture partner [ORG Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp] ( [ORG SAIC] ) . The [ORG China Business Post] reported 040209 that [MISC German] auto giant [ORG Volkswagen AG] had decided against the further transfer of a technical platform for the [PER Santana] sedan model to joint venture partner [ORG Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp] ( [ORG SAIC] ) . Discontinuing these technology transfers would cause several millions of yuan 's of losses to [ORG SAIC] . The [ORG China Business Post] said [ORG SAIC] had invested large sums in the scheduled acquisition of the [LOC Platform] , including acquiring an auto manufacturing plant in [LOC Yizheng] city in eastern [LOC Jiangsu] province . The reported plan was for [ORG SAIC] to produce a new sedan model designed on the [PER Santana] platform and with the car set to be launched in 040500 . The [ORG China Business Post] said the termination was due in part to [ORG Volkswagen] 's adjustment of strategies regarding [LOC China] and to ineffective communication with [ORG Volkswagen] 's [MISC Chinese] partners . [ORG Volkswagen] on 040209 rejected this [ORG China Business Post] report that [ORG Volkswagen] had put a stop to technology transfers of [PER Santana] sedans to [ORG SAIC] . [ORG Volkswagen group China] spokeswoman [PER Melanie Behrens] said that the statements made in the [ORG China Business Post] about the stop of knowledge transfer from [ORG VW] to [ORG SAIC] are not true . [PER Behrens] said that [ORG Volkswagen] does not know where these claims came from and is still working on the subject and trying to clarify the situation . [ORG SAIC] was not immediately available for comment . [ORG SAIC] also has a joint venture with US-based [ORG General Motors] . Analysts said this issue highlights what might be an increasing problem for foreign auto makers as [LOC China] 's government increases support of domestic car companies in hopes of building stand-alone name brands . Many [MISC Chinese] car-makers with overseas venture partners have begun researching and developing cars independently . [ORG Volkswagen] is [LOC China] 's number one passenger car-maker and has two joint ventures in [LOC China] , [ORG Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive Company] and [ORG Faw (] [ORG First Automotive Works] ) [ORG Volkswagen Automotive Company] . Approximately 633000 of [ORG Volkswagen] 's own cars were sold in [LOC China] in 030000 , up from 510000 in 020000 . [ORG SAIC] sold a total of 800000 sedans in 030000 . [ORG SAIC] 's sedan sales topped other domestic auto makers , most of which are volkswagens and General [PER Motors' buicks] . 2004-02-10 [MISC Libyan] [LOC Arab Jamahiriya] ( [LOC LY] ) International ; proliferation [MISC Libyan] Foreign Minister [PER Abdel Rahman Shalgam] visited [LOC London] during the first visit by a [MISC Libyan] foreign minister since 1969 . [PER Shalgam] stated that [MISC Libyan] officials have had the materials to produce weapons of mass destruction but have decided to abandon [LOC Tripoli] 's weapons of mass destruction program . Foreign Minister [PER Abdel Rahman Shalgam] stated on 10 February 2004 during a visit to [LOC London] that [MISC Libyan] officials had all the means to make weapons of mass destruction but never decided to produce the weapons . [PER Shalgam] 's visit to [LOC London] is the first by a [MISC Libyan] foreign minister since 1969 . [PER Shalgam] stated during a press conference alongside [MISC British] Foreign Minister [PER Jack Straw] that [MISC Libyan] officials have had the equipment , the material , the know-how and the scientists to make weapons of mass destruction . [PER Shalgam] stated that having flour , water and fire does not mean having bread . Officials in [LOC Tripoli] stated on 19 December 2003 that [MISC Libyan] officials were abandoning [LOC Tripoli] 's weapons of mass destruction program following months of secret talks with [MISC British] and [LOC U.S.] officials . [PER Shalgam] stated the program 's abandonment was not imposed on [MISC Libyan] officials . [PER Shalgam] stated [MISC Libyan] officials want [MISC American] and [MISC British] aid which would be more beneficial to [LOC Libya] than making weapons of mass destruction . [PER Straw] stated the [MISC Libyan] officials' decision was a courageous step and that the announcement of the decision paved the way for the former pariah state of [LOC Libya] 's reintegration into the international community . [PER Straw] stated that the announcement showed that problems of proliferation can with good will be tackled through discussion and engagement . [PER Straw] stated the [MISC Libyan] officials' decision should benefit the whole region and make the world a safer place . [PER Straw] stated that progress was being made on moves to dismantle [LOC Libya] 's program following the announcement in December 2003 . 2004-02-16 [LOC United States] ( [LOC US] ) International ; terrorism ; government A draft report prepared for the [ORG EU] executive stated that the [ORG European Union] should massively increase research on security issues in order to better protect civilians from terrorist attacks . A draft report prepared for the [ORG EU] executive stated that the [ORG European Union] should massively increase research on security issues in order to better protect civilians from terrorist attacks . The report is created by a working group including Research Commissioner [PER Philippe Busquin] and enterprise Commissioner [PER Erkki Liikanen] . It recommends that up to two billion euros be spent per year on a vast pan-European research program . The [ORG European Security Research Program] ( [ORG ESRP] ) would receive [ORG EU] funding beginning in 2007 . It is the most ambitious of several recommendations the group is likely to issue when it presents its final conclusions in two or three weeks . The draft report recommends starting security research funding with one billion euros per year in 2007 . It will then slowly increase the annual budget to two billion euros . [MISC European] spending currently lags behind the [LOC United States] . The [LOC United States'] [ORG Homeland Security Department] receives one billion dollars annually plus research credit from the [ORG Defense Department] . The report stated that there is no reason why [ORG European Security Research] should not be funded at a level similar to the [LOC United States] . The [ORG European Commission] strategy allows for a preliminary period of studies and pilot projects from 2004 to 2006 . It promotes EU-wide synergies in research on top safety issues including protection against bio-terrorism and improved networking between civilian and military authorities across the continent . 65 million euros have been earmarked for the 2004-2006 phase of the research program according to an exploratory [ORG Plan of Action] presented by the [ORG Commission] on February 3 , 2004 . The Working Group on security research was formed last October and includes [ORG EU] parliamentarians and experts from related industries in addition to the two commissioners . 2004-02-29 [LOC France] ( FR ) ; [LOC Monaco] ( mc ) terrorism ; international [MISC French] anti-terrorist judge calls terrorism serious threat despite dispersal and weakening of [ORG al-Qaeda] . Restraining extremist groups is becoming increasingly difficult because of how the groups are financed . [LOC France] 's top anti-terrorist judge [PER Jean-Louis Bruguiere] stated to [ORG AFP] 29 February 2004 that [ORG al-Qaeda] is still capable of inspiring people to carry out attacks despite being much weaker since the 11 September 2001 attacks and the [MISC U.S.-led] war in [LOC Afghanistan] . [PER Bruguiere] has led the [MISC French] legal effort against extremism and terrorism in recent years . [PER Bruguiere] stated -- The global fight against terrorism is against an increasingly elusive enemy with access to funds virtually impossible to control . The threat comes from long-standing members of [ORG al-Qaeda] . [ORG Al-Qaeda] is an organization which still exists but has been significantly weakened by the neutralization and capture of a number of its members and of those in charge . In an interview in [LOC Monaco] Bruguiere called global terrorism a scattered and polymorphous threat . [PER Bruguiere] was in [LOC Monaco] attending a meeting of the international organization involved in [MISC Mediterranean] political studies called club of [LOC Monaco] . Dozens of alleged members of [ORG al-Qaeda] have been captured or killed since the group claimed responsibility for the 11 September attacks on [LOC New York] and [LOC Washington D.C.] but authorities have not been able to locate [ORG al-Qaeda] 's leader [PER Osama bin Laden] or his top deputy [PER Ayman al-Zawahiri] . On 24 February 2004 [PER Zawahiri] appeared in 2 taped messages broadcast by the [MISC Arab-language] [MISC Al-Arabiya] and [LOC Al-Jazeera] television stations calling in remarks attributed to him for renewed attacks on the [LOC United States] . [PER Bruguiere] stated -- Restraining extremist groups particularly across [LOC Europe] was becoming increasingly difficult because of how the groups are financed . The networks operating in [LOC Europe] benefit from micro-financing and not from macro-financing . Fraudulent charge cards could be used to withdraw significant sums which are then distributed through micro-channels outside the classic financial circles and are practically impossible to detect . Use of false credit cards is growing . It is necessary to expand existing laws to combat the funding mechanisms . All existing legal or institutional measures are insufficient to neutralize this threat . [ORG Al-Qaeda] is only 1 of many worldwide threats among the many radical [MISC Islamic] organizations involved in an international jihad and sharing the [ORG al-Qaeda] strategy that are pursuing regional options . The groups are particularly active in [LOC Africa] , [LOC Asia] and [LOC Europe] . [PER Bruguiere] made these comments before going into a meeting with approximately 40 high-ranking or former top international officials . Since the September 2001 strikes on the [LOC United States] deadly large-scale attacks have occurred in other parts of the world . Among the targets have been a synagogue in northern [LOC Tunisia] , a nightclub in [LOC Bali] , a hotel in [LOC Kenya] and numerous locations in [LOC Chechnya] and [LOC Russia] . Analysts have warned that [LOC Iraq] could become a breeding ground for terrorist organizations if a political solution is not found soon .

On 16 March 2005 a [MISC Japanese] local assembly passed a resolution stressing the [MISC Japanese] government 's claim to a small island chain controlled by [LOC South Korea] . Anti-Japanese protests occurred in [LOC Seoul] after the passage of the resolution . [MISC Japanese] government websites have come under occasional cyber attacks especially from countries which [LOC Japan] invaded in the first half of the 20th century . In January 2005 , administrators of the [LOC Yasukuni Shrine] dedicated to [LOC Japan] 's war dead stated the [LOC Yasukuni Shrine] 's website had been the target of Internet attacks . Most of these attacks were via e-mails written in [MISC Chinese] . In 2000 , hackers accessed [MISC Japanese] government websites and left messages in [MISC Chinese] and [MISC English] ranging from insults to attacks on [LOC Japan] 's wartime past , after [MISC Japanese] conservative groups held a forum in the western city of [LOC Osaka] to deny the 1937 massacre in the [MISC Chinese] city of [LOC Nanjing] by [MISC Japanese] troops . 2005-03-21 [LOC Taiwan] ( [LOC TW] ) International ; crime ; business ; technology ; Telecom [LOC Taiwan] 's chip company [ORG United Microelectronics Corp] ( [ORG UMC] ) announced on March 21 , 2005 that it would obtain a 15 percent stake in [MISC China-based] chipmaker hejian technology through a compensation package . [LOC Taiwan] 's chip company [ORG United Microelectronics Corp] ( [ORG UMC] ) announced on March 21 , 2005 that it would obtain a 15 percent stake in [MISC China-based] chipmaker hejian technology through a compensation package . The stake was valued at 3.5 billion [LOC Taiwan] dollars ( 110 million [LOC US] dollars ) and the investment goes to the core of cross-Straits investment ties . Both companies are being investigated in [LOC Taiwan] for alleged breach of trust . [ORG UMC] Chairman [PER Robert Tsao] said the company had submitted a letter to [LOC Taiwan] 's [ORG Investment Commission] asking for assistance in transferring the stake . It said it was compensation for previous assistance . [ORG UMC] manufactures cutting-edge microchips . The chips are installed in a wide range of computers and electronics found in mobile phones , televisions and cars . The technology is highly prized in [LOC Taiwan] . Market analysts believe the assistance involved a technology transfer from [ORG UMC] to hejian and the compensation through the stake represents a payment . No cash changed hands . [PER Tsao] said the letter followed a verbal promise made by hejian technology to pay [ORG UMC] a reasonable amount of compensation . That included a commitment to merge the two companies . [PER Tsao] said no formal written agreements had been signed . Both companies would next seek a strategic partnership if the [ORG Investment Commission] approved the deal . [ORG UMC] is the world 's second largest wafer foundry and has recognized its investment in hejian which had previously been denied . [LOC Taiwan] authorities lifted a ban in March 2002 on mainland-bound investment in eight-inch ( 200 millimeter ) silicon wafer plants . This followed assurances from potential investors that the island would not lose out on transferred technology . Prosecutors raided the homes and offices of [ORG UMC] executives in February 2005 as part of a probe into the alleged illegal supply of funds , technology and human resources to hejian . [LOC Hejian] was founded in November 2001 with capital of 350 million [LOC U.S.] dollars .

The countries discussed exchanging information , controlling chemicals needed to make illicit drugs , controlling amphetamines , providing drug treatment and sustainable alternative development . 5 projects worth 10.6 million dollars are currently in operation under an action plan implemented as part of the 1993 pact with [ORG UNDOC] . [MISC Cambodian] Prime Minister [PER Hun Sen] opened the meeting and stated -- Regional cross-border crime flourishes due to increasingly open borders and more amicable economic and social relations among countries in the region . Producing and trafficking illegal drugs is only 1 aspect of organized transnational crime . Money Laundering is a particular concern for the [MISC Mekong Sub-region] because this money will fund terrorist activities . [LOC Cambodia] is considered an increasingly important trans-shipment point for illicit drugs in the region .

Trojan horses do not replicate from machine to machine as viruses do . [ORG Symantec] stated that the ransomware enters the computer via weaknesses in the victim 's Web browser and then scans the hard drive and encrypts any text-based documents found . 20050604 the [MISC British] weekly [ORG New Scientist] stated that 1 case of ransomware has been discovered which may pioneer a new and dangerous generation of malicious software . The known ransomware program is titled pgpcoder in an attempt to undermine the legal , popular and highly secure encryption product pretty good privacy . [ORG New Scientist] stated that the [LOC California] web-filtering company websense discovered pgpcoder and notified the [ORG FBI] . Pgpcoder used an unsophisticated algorithm to encrypt the data so that a computer consultant was able to decode the documents easily . [ORG New Scientist] stated that future virus writers may compel victims to pay by encrypting files using military-grade systems .

One of the missiles broke up over two [MISC Turkish] villages . It caused no injuries . The officials stated the missile tests were normal . It was [LOC Syria] 's first since 2001 and caused embarrassment to [LOC Turkey] . [LOC Syria] decided to make the missile tests public because the [LOC U.S.] silence about them was unsettling . The [MISC Israeli] officials in [LOC Tel Aviv] told the daily that the missile tests were part of a [MISC Syrian] missile development project using [MISC North Korean] technology . The three missiles were the older [MISC Scud B] that has a range of 300 kilometers ( 185 miles ) and two [MISC Scud] D 's with a range of 700 kilometers ( 435 miles ) . The missiles are designed to deliver air-burst chemical weapons . The official said the launchings on May 27 , 2003 were [MISC Syrian] President [PER Bashir al-Assad] 's response to [LOC U.S.] and [ORG UN] pressures that forced [PER al-Assad] to withdraw [MISC Syrian] troops from neighboring [LOC Lebanon] . This was in the wake of the February assassination of former Prime Minister [PER Rafik Harari] . A senior [MISC Israeli] military official said the tests are probably needed for the missile project but [PER Bashir] is taking a risk and sending a message . Anti-Syrian journalist [PER Samir kassir] was killed June 2 , 2005 when a bomb exploded under kassir 's car in [LOC Beirut] . The attack is blamed on the pro-Syrian regime and widely condemned at home and abroad . [LOC Syria] angrily denied the accusations through its official news agency , [ORG SANA] . The [MISC Israeli] officials said the [MISC Syrian] missiles were launched from northern [LOC Syria] Newar minakh .

The [ORG China Times] stated that the [PER Hsiung Feng] cruise missile was developed by the military-run chungshan [ORG Institute of Science] and Technology , has a range of 1,000 kilometers ( 600 miles ) and could be used to attack military bases in southeast [LOC China] . The [ORG China Times] stated that once the missile was deployed it would mark the first time that [LOC Taiwan] is able to put strategic weapons into use and that the political and military impact of this would be far-reaching . [ORG The Times] said Defense Minister [PER Lee] jye witnessed the test firing of the missile from chiupeng military base in the southern [ORG Pingtung County] and that the missile flew over 500 kilometers ( 300 miles ) before hitting its target . The defense ministry declined to comment on the report . The report did not specify when the test took place but speculated that it could have been in March . The missile is expected to go into pilot production later in 050000 or 060000 . [LOC Taiwan] is striving to build up its missile defense capabilities to counter the military threat from [LOC China] . Officials state that [LOC China] has targeted [LOC Taiwan] with approximately 700 ballistic missiles . [LOC Taiwan] 's cabinet approved a revised arms deal with the [LOC United States] in 050500 worth almost 15.5 billion dollars after a previous proposal was rejected by parliament . The arms package over a 15-year period beginning in 050000 includes 8 conventional submarines , a modified version of the Patriot anti-missile system and a fleet of anti-submarine aircraft . The package is pending final approval by [ORG Parliament] . This large budget proposal has provoked debate [LOC Taiwan] as critics said the spending could further provoke [LOC China] and heighten cross-strait tensions . [LOC China] considers [LOC Taiwan] part of its territory awaiting reunification since they split at the end of the civil war in 490000 , and has repeatedly threatened to invade if [LOC Taiwan] moves towards formal independence . 2005-07-08 [LOC Brazil] ( [ORG BR] ) ; [LOC United States] ( [LOC US] ) International ; health ; money [MISC Brazilian] government and [ORG Abbott Laboratories] agree on lower price for [MISC AIDS] drug [MISC Kaletra] in response to [MISC Brazilian] threat to violate the patent . According to [ORG WHO] studies the price of the drug was exorbitant and the [MISC Brazilian] government demanded that [ORG Abbot] lower the price . On 08 July 2005 [LOC Brazil] 's [ORG Ministry of Health] stated that [LOC U.S.] company [ORG Abbott Laboratories] has agreed to reduce the price of its HIV/AIDS drug [MISC Kaletra] to prevent [LOC Brazil] from violating the company 's patent as it had threatened . The ministry said in a statement -- The agreement made with [ORG Abbott] guarantees the [ORG Ministry 's] proposed objectives ensuring a significant price cut for the drug over the next 6 years . [ORG Abbott] agreed to a technology transfer procedure so that [LOC Brazil] 's state-run farmanguinhos laboratories can begin producing [MISC Kaletra] in 2009 . The agreement guarantees access to [LOC Meltrex] by [MISC Brazilian] patients . [LOC Meltrex] is an updated version of [MISC Kaletra] that is pending approval by [LOC U.S.] health authorities . Over the 6 years which the Agreement covers [LOC Brazil] expects to save up to 259 million [LOC U.S.] dollars in drug purchases .

Currently 24000 patients in [LOC Brazil] receive [MISC Kaletra] . The number is expected to increase to 60000 by 2011 . On 24 June 2005 [LOC Brazil] declared [MISC Kaletra] a drug of national interest and demanded that [ORG Abbott] decide within 10 days to either agree to lower its price for the drug or face a violation of its patent . On 24 June 2005 [MISC Brazilian] Health Minister [PER Humberto Costa] stated that the price paid by the [MISC Brazilian] Government to purchase [MISC Kaletra] represented a yearly cost of 2630 [LOC U.S.] dollars per patient . [PER Costa] stated that this price is considered exorbitant because studies of the [ORG World Health Organization] ( [ORG WTO] ) showed that for large-scale production the fair price including a considerable margin of profit should range from 480 to 540 [LOC U.S.] dollars per patient per year . [PER Costa] stated that [LOC Brazil] planned to have a less expensive generic copy of the patented drug produced locally by a state-owned company . Illinois-based [ORG Abbott] stated that [LOC Brazil] 's demands were illegal and warned that developing unproven alternative HIV medication posed significant consequences for patients .

[MISC Pakistani] analysts said on 050715 that [LOC Pakistan] 's network of madrassa [MISC Islamic] schools has close links with [MISC Islamic] extremists in [LOC Britain] , who supply them with extremist recruits and vital funding . On 050714 [MISC British] Foreign Secretary [PER Jack Straw] expressed concern over what goes on in some [MISC Pakistani] madrassas . It has emerged that [PER Shehzad Tanweer] was one of the terrorists who carried out the bombing of an underground subway train at [LOC Aldgate] in east [LOC London] . [PER Tanweer] was said by his uncle to have gone in 041200 to a [MISC Pakistani] madrassa , wanting to learn to recite the [MISC Koran] by heart . Sources in [LOC Pakistan] said that [MISC British] authorities should look inside [MISC British] borders where the [MISC South Asian] community is turning to increasingly extremist religious views . [PER Kamila hyat] of [LOC Pakistan] 's [ORG Human Rights Commision] said that militancy is being exported in the reverse direction . Younger [MISC Pakistanis] coming from [LOC Britain] have very extreme and hard-line views and view [MISC British] culture as decadent . When Pakistani-British youngsters come to [LOC Pakistan] they are surprised to see women walking around without burqas . Analysts say [PER Tanweer] 's trip to [LOC Pakistan] was by no means unusual , as many [MISC Pakistani] families who emigrated some 40 or 50 years ago and settled in [LOC Britain] send their children for religious teaching at madrassas . [PER Hyat] said they want to ensure their children are not alienated from their family faith and hope a brief stint of a few terms will help ground them in [MISC Islamic] and [MISC Pakistani] culture . [PER Hyat] said that complaints have nonetheless been received from parents in [LOC Pakistan] who are very concerned about teenagers who graduate and then go back to the [LOC UK] for [ORG University] . The parents of some madrassa students are saying that the young men are somewhat confused when away from the [LOC UK] for the first time and are consistently being approached by other [MISC Pakistanis] or by [MISC Arabs] who attempt to get them to join extremist groups . Such students bring extremism back to the [LOC UK] when coming back home . Madrassas continue to produce a peculiar state of mind in students , said [PER Hasan Askari] . [PER Askari] is the former head of political science department at [LOC Lahore] 's [ORG Punjab University] . [PER Askari] said that these students having a state of mind of religious orthodoxy are vulnerable to violence and extremism . Some of the radical religious schools in [LOC Pakistan] have thrived on funds regularly coming from supporters among the [MISC Muslim] community in [LOC Britain] . Security sources say that in one case , several thousand pounds were sent to outlawed [ORG Sipah-e-Sahaba] of [LOC Pakistan] in 030000 . [MISC Pakistani] security officials informed the [MISC British] authorities and identified the man who sent the money as Mullah [PER Hamid] . Mullah [PER Hamid] was a prayer leader in a mosque in [LOC Glasgow] . [LOC Pakistan] admits that some of the estimated 10,000 madrassas in [LOC Pakistan] are breeding grounds for extremism . Madrassas have been a part of [MISC Muslim] social life on the [LOC Indian subcontinent] for decades . In the 1980s they became a recruiting ground for the [MISC US-sponsored] militant movement against the [MISC Soviet] occupation of neighboring [LOC Afghanistan] . President [PER Pervez Musharraf] has been campaigning since early 030000 for reform of madrassas . Many madrassas are unregulated and the [ORG International Crisis Group] says 1.5 million students attend such [MISC Islamic] schools .

The 20050707 terrorist attacks that killed 56 on [LOC London] underground trains and a double-decker bus prompted demands for further anti-terror laws and surveillance of [MISC Islamist] militants . Director of the Center for the Study of terrorism at the [ORG University of St. Andrews] in [LOC Scotland] [PER Magnus ranstorp] stated that the militants may be forced underground into the cybersphere , which has potential utility for command , communication , and especially recruitment . [PER Londonistan] is the [MISC Islamist] core operating in [LOC London] . The two main components of londonistan are the international [ORG Jihad Movement] and the exiled opposition to current [MISC Arab] or [MISC Muslim] regimes .

Police stated that on 18 October 2005 2 militants entered the fortified [LOC Srinagar] home of junior Education Minister [PER Ghulam Nabi] lone of the [ORG People 's Democratic Party] ( [ORG PDF] ) and shot him to death . 2 policemen and 1 of the attackers also died and 5 others were injured in the gunfight . The attack occurred less than 1 day after suspected rebels shot and killed a prominent communist politician in [LOC Indian Kashmir] . The daily violence has continued despite a ceasefire declaration in areas affected by the 08 October 2005 earthquake . The violence that has occurred since the earthquake has been attributed to an umbrella group of separatists called the [ORG United Jihad Council] . Some insurgents have joined relief efforts . The [MISC Indian] military has not reacted to insurgents' relief efforts and has continued counter-insurgency operations . The army states that while it directs aid work it has also killed more than 30 militants since the earthquake . Federal Intelligence agencies have been working to assess the damage to insurgents in and around [LOC Muzaffarabad] . [LOC Muzaffarabad] is the militants' headquarters and the capital of [MISC Pakistani] [LOC Kashmir] . Army chief General [PER J. J. Singh] stated -- The epicenter of the 7.6-magnitude earthquake was in [LOC Muzaffarabad] and caused damage among the militant groups . All the terrorist infrastructure in and around [LOC Muzaffarabad] was destroyed and many innocent people died . It is premature to state with certainty what impact the earthquake has had on the militant groups as infrastructure remains intact in other areas in [LOC Pakistan] . The militant groups are seeking either independence for [LOC Kashmir] or absorption into [LOC Pakistan] . Over 1300 people in [LOC Indian Kashmir] and 41000 people in [LOC Pakistan] were killed in the earthquake . The [MISC Indian] government accuses the [MISC Pakistani] government of training , arming and funding the [MISC Islamic] rebellion . The [MISC Pakistani] government denies this charge but states that it does extend moral , political and diplomatic support to [MISC Kashmiri] separatists . Head of military operations in [LOC Indian Kashmir] Brigadier [PER Madan Gopal] expressed confidence on 17 October 2005 that many of the militants had been killed . [PER Gopal] stated that the Hizbul [ORG Mujahedin] and the [ORG Lashkar-e-Toiba] have suffered major losses in the earthquake on the [MISC Pakistani] side . Hizbul [ORG Mujahedin] and [ORG Lashkar-e-Toiba] are groups that carry out frequent attacks . Violence continues despite conflicting opinion on the extent of damage suffered by the rebel groups . Retired General [PER V. N. Sharma] rejects suggestions that the earthquake has critically damaged the core of the insurgency . [PER Sharma] was [LOC India] 's army chief when the insurgency erupted in 1989 . [PER Sharma] states that such suggestions are unrealistic . [PER Sharma] states that he does not think the insurgency has been destroyed because the groups are mobile units and live in tented accommodations . [PER Sharma] states that the destruction of a few communications centers or sub-command posts has little affect on the Greater organization . Approximately 44000 people have died in the insurgency . Head of the [ORG Military-funded Institute of Defense] studies and analysis in [LOC New Delhi] [PER Uday Bhaskar] also warned against complacency stating that loss of firepower and manpower is unimportant . [PER Bhaskar] stated that the militants will soon regroup because they are highly motivated and believe they can achieve their goal of freeing [LOC Kashmir] from [MISC Indian] control with violence . The [MISC Indian] government is also taking a cautious approach . [MISC Indian] Defense Minister [PER Pranab Mukherjee] on 17 October 2005 called for vigilance along the 430-mile [LOC de facto] border which divides the two [MISC Kashmirs] . [PER Mukherjee] stated -- Militants have attempted to infiltrate [LOC Indian Kashmir] approximately 5 times since 08 October 2005 including twice on a single day . Some of the militants wanted to take advantage of the unstable situation in the region . The presence of civilians among the troops on relief work could help militants cross the [LOC de facto] border . There could be more infiltration attempts next week before winter snow blocks the mountain passes . 2005-12-06 [LOC France] ( FR ) ; [LOC China] ( [ORG CN] ) International ; technology ; science ; Government ; energy ; business ; money ; leader During a 4-day tour of [LOC France] [MISC Chinese] Prime Minister [PER Wen] states that [MISC French] company [ORG Areva] must improve its offer for a nuclear reactor deal with regard to price and technology transfer . [PER Wen] also signed a deal to initiate student exchange programs and attempted to allay anxiety about [LOC China] 's rapidly growing power . On 06 December 2005 [MISC Chinese] Prime Minister [PER Wen Jiabao] stated that in order to win a contract to build third-generation nuclear reactors in [LOC China] [LOC France] must improve its offer in terms of both cost and transfers of technology . [PER Wen] was speaking on the 3rd day of a 4-day visit to [LOC France] . On a tour of the elite [ORG Polytechnique Science University] in the southern suburbs of [LOC Paris] [PER Wen] stated that [LOC China] hopes [LOC France] will offer more attractive conditions on technology transfer as well as price so that [MISC Franco-Chinese] cooperation in this field can develop . The [MISC French] company [ORG Areva] is bidding for an 8 billion [LOC U.S.] dollar ( 6.8 billion euro ) deal to construct 4 reactors in [LOC China] as are [LOC U.S.] company [ORG Westinghouse] and [MISC Russian] company atomstroyexport . The bidding among the 3 companies has been competitive . [LOC China] was to have announced a winner by the end of 2005 but has delayed its decision until early next year hoping to elicit better terms from the bidders . On 05 December 2005 during the 4-day visit to [LOC France] a [MISC Chinese] order for 150 medium-range A320 airliners from the [MISC European] consortium [ORG Airbus] was announced .

[PER Wen] stated -- The dynamic young students represented the future of the world . Student exchanges are more important than the purchase of 150 [ORG Airbus] . At present there is economic cooperation between [LOC China] and [LOC France] but with such programs in the future there will be cultural cooperation . In a speech to students , professors and business leaders , [PER Wen] attempted to allay anxiety in [LOC Europe] that [LOC China] 's fast-growing economic power is a threat to the rest of the world . [PER Wen] stated that because [LOC China] suffered so much from foreign invasions it understands the value of peace . [PER Wen] stated that for [LOC China] to choose peace is logical given its history and culture . [LOC China] 's development is not a threat but an opportunity for the world . The [MISC French] have expressed fear that [LOC China] 's low costs and poor standards of social security are attracting economic activity and causing increased unemployment in [LOC Europe] but [PER Wen] argued that growing domestic demand in [LOC China] will eventually lead to new opportunities for foreign exporters . [LOC France] views [LOC China] as a strategic ally in its pursuit of a multipolar world that is not dominated by the [LOC U.S.] though trade relations between [LOC France] and [LOC China] remain low . [LOC France] ranks 15th among suppliers to [LOC China] providing only 1.4 percent of [LOC China] 's foreign needs . 2005-12-12 [LOC Republic of Korea] ( [LOC KR] ) International ; technology ; military ; Government ; business ; money [ORG Eurocopter] won a large contract with the [LOC Republic of Korea] to produce troop-carrying helicopters .

The attack killed 34 people and was one of the deadliest single assaults since 1989 . In 1989 militants launched an insurgency in [LOC Indian-controlled Kashmir] seeking independence or a merger with [LOC Islamic] [LOC Pakistan] . [LOC Kashmir] is [LOC India] 's only Muslim-majority state . [LOC India] is dominated by [LOC Hinduism] . [LOC India] accuses [LOC Islamabad] of funding and training guerrillas . The guerrillas cross the [ORG Line of Control] that divides [LOC Kashmir] and carry out attacks on the [MISC Indian] side . Tens of thousands of [MISC Indian] troops , guerrillas and civilians have been killed . [LOC Pakistan] says it only provides moral and political support for [LOC Kashmir] 's named freedom fighters . Diplomatic intervention and [PER Musharraf] 's suppression of militants and cross-border attacks have decreased tensions of war . There is strong resentment among [LOC Pakistan] 's conservative [MISC Islamic] groups . Fighter with [ORG Hezb-ul Mujahedeen] Anas [PER Javed] said that [LOC Pakistan] soldiers deployed near the [LOC Kashmir] border used to pray for success in Jihad but are now terrorists according to [PER Musharra] . [ORG Hezb-ul Mujahedeen] is one of the main militant groups fighting in [LOC Kashmir] . The leaders of two other outlawed [MISC Pakistani] militant groups that operate in [LOC Kashmir] [ORG Lashkar-e-Tayyaba] and [ORG Jaish-e-Mohammed] are in police custody and under house arrest respectively . [PER Musharraf] 's crackdown has decreased tensions about war . The dispute over [LOC Kashmir] continues with no signs of abating . A Board was created during the rally in [LOC Lahore] bearing the names of militants killed during the 12-year insurgency . [PER Safdar Sadiqui] 's son was on it . [PER Sadiqui] 's son was killed in [LOC Kashmir] in 1993 at age 22 .

The [MISC Cuban] Government seeks to increase pharmaceutical profits by significantly expanding overseas markets through the development of novel pharmaceuticals and the sale of the world 's most lucrative biotechnology drug , erythropoetin ( [ORG EPO] ) . [ORG Amgen Inc.] invented [ORG EPO] and shares patent rights with [PER Johnson] & [PER Johnson] and [ORG Kirin Brewery] in the most lucrative industrialized markets -- the [LOC US] , [LOC Europe] and [LOC Japan] . In 2001 [ORG EPO] generated 6 billion dollars in sales for the 3 corporations . [ORG Amgen] sells [ORG EPO] in the [LOC US] as epogen for over 36 dollars per dose . [LOC US] epogen consumers pay over 10000 dollars each annually for the drug . [ORG EPO] is a genetically engineered protein used legally by kidney dialysis and chemotherapy patients and illegally by athletes to increase the concentration of oxygenated red blood cells . An increasing quantity of biotechnology drugs are produced without any attempts to obtain licenses in developing nations . [LOC US] patent holders consider the trade in generic drugs a violation to their intellectual property . Consumers in developing countries appreciate lower prices on generic drugs . [LOC Cuba] considers the generic drug trade good business and currently manufactures [ORG EPO] for sale in [LOC Argentina] , [LOC Brazil] , [LOC India] and other countries that do not acknowledge most [LOC US] and [MISC European] drug patents . [MISC Cuban] biotechnology executive [PER Blanca tormo] stated that [LOC Cuba] carefully abides by intellectual property laws and exclusively sells [ORG EPO] in countries in which no entity has exclusive patent rights . The largest potential pharmaceutical market is in the 1.3 billion person [MISC Chinese] market . [ORG Amgen] , [ORG Kirin] , the small [MISC Canadian] biotechnology company [ORG Dragon Pharmaceuticals Inc.] and at lease 4 [MISC Chinese] companies currently sell [ORG EPO] in [LOC China] . The generic product costs as low as 5 dollars per dose in [LOC China] . By joining the [ORG World Trade Organization] in 2001 [LOC China] agreed to abide by [ORG WTO] intellectual property agreements but the agreements contain mechanisms allowing developing nations to circumvent patents , particularly in pharmaceuticals , when public health concerns are deemed to override the patents . Current state of biotechnology in [LOC Cuba] -- The [MISC Cuban] biotechnology industry currently generates 100 million dollars annually and reaches markets in over 40 countries . [LOC Cuba] 's genetic engineering and biotechnology center occupies modern towers approved by [PER Fidel Castro] and employs over 1000 people to engineer proteins to combat major terminal illnesses . [LOC Cuba] currently produces novel biotechnology products: hepatitis B and meningitis B vaccines , a skin growth factor , interferons , thrombosis and heart attack medicines and [MISC AIDS] treatments . [LOC Cuba] has produced over 78 million doses of hepatitis B vaccine . [LOC Cuba] licensed its meningitis B vaccine to the [MISC British] company [ORG GlaxoSmithKline] , which hopes to eventually sell the vaccine in the [LOC United States] under a Clinton-era exemption to the [MISC Cuban] trade embargo . [LOC Cuba] is cooperating with the small [MISC Canadian] company [ORG YM] biosciences on trials of a head and neck cancer treatment . [LOC Cuba] is seeking further partnerships with foreign companies in vaccine research for [MISC AIDS] , 8 types of cancer and cholera . [MISC Cuban] officials including attendees of the annual bio 2002 Industry Conference 20020600 in [LOC Toronto] stated that negotiations for new biotechnology trade and production agreements were in progress with [LOC Brazil] , [LOC Malaysia] , [LOC Netherlands] , [LOC Spain] , [LOC Mexico] , [LOC Venezuela] , [LOC Vietnam] , [LOC Ukraine] , [LOC Germany] and the [LOC United States] . [LOC Cuba] has or is negotiating technology transfer agreements with 14 countries , chiefly developing nations including [LOC India] , [LOC Algeria] and [LOC South Africa] . 20020500 [LOC US] Undersecretary of State for [MISC Arms Control] [PER John Bolton] stated that the [LOC US] believes [LOC Cuba] has at least a limited offensive biological warfare research and development effort and has provided dual-use biotechnology to other rogue states . Scientists , [PER Castro] , and former [MISC US] President [PER Jimmy Carter] , who visited [LOC Cuba] directly after [ORG Bolton] 's statement , dismissed [ORG Bolton] 's statement as unfair . [PER Tormo] stated that [ORG Bolton] unintentionally increased publicity for the [MISC Cuban] biotechnology program . 2002-07-18 [LOC Russia] ( [MISC RU] ) International ; Government ; technology ; military ; space [MISC Russian] military space forces put on test duty an optical space-object tracking facility located in the ex-Soviet republic of [LOC Tajikistan] The [MISC Russian] military space forces on 020718 inaugurated an optical tracking facility that is intended to monitor objects in space and put it on test duty . The okno optical tracking facility is near the town of [LOC Nurek] in the central region of the ex-Soviet republic of [LOC Tajikistan] and located 50 kilometers ( 30 miles ) southeast of the [MISC Tajik] capital [LOC Dushanbe] . [MISC Russian] Space Forces said in a statement carried by the [ORG Interfax-military] news agency that the okno ( window ) complex is capable of tracking objects 40000 kilometers ( 24800 miles ) from Earth . The okno offers a better range and precision than standard radar facilities according to the Space Forces . The report did not elaborate on how the okno works . The report saids Space Forces chief Col.-Gen . [PER Anatoly Perminov] traveled to the site to report on the facility 's launch to Defense Minister [PER Sergei Ivanov] , . According to images on the [ORG Federation of] [MISC American] [ORG Scientists'] web site , the facility involves telescope-like equipment housed in several large spheres . The okno is located in [LOC Tajikistan] 's mountains 2200 meters ( 7260 feet ) above sea level and takes advantage of the area 's fine weather and high transparency of the atmosphere . Such conditions are not found elsewhere in the former [LOC Soviet Union] . The site describes it as similar to the [LOC U.S.] GEODSS system , or ground-based electro-optical [MISC Deep Space Surveillance] . Three such [LOC U.S.] facilities are operational . The construction of the facility started in 790000 , but stopped after the 910000 [LOC Soviet] collapse when [LOC Tajikistan] slid into a 5 year civil war that undermined its economy and left its population in deep poverty . About 25000 [MISC Russian] troops and border guards are deployed in [LOC Tajikistan] to help protect its volatile southern border with [LOC Afghanistan] and prevent drug smuggling . 2002-08-08 [LOC Italy] ( IT ) International ; Telecom ; business ; Government ; technology ; politics [LOC Italy] is leading a technology transfer initiative developed by the [ORG G-8] countries which will improve the technology of developing countries . The goal of the initiative is to provide the infrastructure and good governance needed to alleviate poverty . [LOC Italy] sponsors technology transfer to developing countries as a form of foreign aid and alleviating poverty . Premier [PER Silvio Berlusconi] supported and sponsored the initiative with counterparts at recent international gatherings including the last [ORG G-8 Summit] in [LOC Canada] . [LOC Italy] persuaded partners to let [LOC Italy] lead the [ORG G-8 summit] 's e-government initiative called [ORG DOT Force] or digital opportunity task force . Former [ORG IBM] executive and current technology minister of [LOC Italy] [PER Lucio Stanca] is leading [LOC Italy] 's [MISC Internet] program for developing countries as part of the [ORG Group of Eight] 's efforts to reduce the digital divides . [PER Silvio Berlusconi] gave [PER Lucio Stanca] his current role of modernizing [LOC Italy] 's bureaucracy . [PER Lucio Stanca] stated that [LOC Italy] will not targeting countries that have very basic needs . The first technology transfer projects will be implemented in the fall . One such project is creating an electronic database for real estate in [LOC Mozambique] . So far 12 million euros or 12 million dollars have been allocated to finance the initial phase of these projects . This cost is only a fraction of the total cost . [LOC Italy] is financing most of the cost but the [ORG World Bank] and possibly some private telecommunications companies are also contributing . [PER Lucio Stanca] stated that the world must solve the problem of world hunger , disease and education but in order to do that the world must first help create good governance . The rationale behind creating good governance is that by making the public administration of developing countries more transparent and accountable developing countries would become more attractive potential recipients of traditional forms of aid such as loans and investments . In effect good governance would invalidate the reason used by countries that do not do enough that donating is not appropriate because it is impossible to know whether the aid would reach its true destination . The [ORG United Nations] telecommunications agency stated that 83 countries in [LOC Africa] , [LOC Asia] , and the former [LOC Soviet Union] still have less than 10 telephone lines for every 100 people . Other studies note that even though the [MISC Internet] has been in use for more than a decade , only about 10 percent of the world 's population has access to it . Reducing the digital divide has taken on a central role in the fight against global poverty in recent years . The [ORG United Nations] has repeatedly stated that the world 's poor may be further marginalized if there is no improvement in access to information technology . Reducing the digital divide was declared a priority at last year 's [ORG G-8 Summit] in [LOC Genoa] which included [LOC Russia] . [LOC Italy] launched pilot programs in 5 countries at a conference in [LOC Sicily] sponsored by the [ORG United Nations] and [LOC Italy] in April , 2002 . The Conference focused on how technologies can be used to improve administration in developing countries . The plan for [LOC Albania] is computerization of demographic surveys . The plan for [LOC Jordan] is e-procurement which will allow online trading , auctions , payment and settlement of bills . The plan for [LOC Tunisia] is the creation of electronic databases to facilitate tax collection . The plan for [LOC Nigeria] and [LOC Mozambique] is the creation an electronic database for real estate . [MISC Washington-based] adviser at [ORG World Learning] [PER Ann hudock] stated that poverty reduction will only occur when the poor themselves are brought into the policy process . Oxfram [LOC America] is a nonprofit development group based in [LOC Boston] . [ORG World Learning] is an organization promoting education and justice . 2002-10-12 [LOC Russia] ( [MISC RU] ) International ; Government ; technology ; military ; space ; weapons [MISC Russian] Navy , [ORG Air Force] and space forces successfully carried out a series of test firings of missiles [MISC Russian] defense officials said the [MISC Russian] Navy , [ORG Air Force] and space forces successfully carried out a series of test firings of missiles on 021012 . A spokesman for the [MISC Russian] Space Forces press service said the [MISC Russian] Space Forces test-fired an [PER RS-12 M Topol] intercontinental ballistic missile . The spokesman said the missile took off from the [LOC Plesetsk cosmodrome] , about 1200 kilometers ( 800 miles ) north of [LOC Moscow] and hit the target at the [ORG Kura Test Range] on the [LOC Kamchatka] peninsula in [LOC Russia] 's [LOC Far East] , about 7000 kilometers ( 4200 miles ) away . The spokesman said the launch was carried out by the [ORG Strategic Rocket Forces] and space forces in accordance with schedule of troops military training . Topol missiles have been on combat duty for 15 years and [LOC Russia] periodically tests them to see if their lifetime can be extended . A defense ministry spokesman said the [MISC Russian] Navy 's northern and Pacific fleets successfully test-fired ballistic missiles from nuclear submarines in the [LOC Barents Sea] to the north and the [LOC Sea of Okhotsk] . The spokesman said the purpose of the tests was to check the efficiency of the military command bodies of the [MISC Russian] armed forces . [ORG Interfax] news agency reported that 2 [MISC Russian] strategic bombers on 021012 launched cruise missiles as part of a training exercise . [ORG Interfax] said a [MISC Tu-160] bomber and a [MISC Tu-95] [LOC MS] bomber launched the missiles against targets located on the military testing grounds in the [LOC Volga] region after a 12-hour training flight . 2002-12-28 [LOC India] ( IN ) ; [LOC Pakistan] ( [LOC PK] ) International ; terrorism ; government [MISC Indian] Deputy Prime Minister accuses [LOC Pakistan] of becoming a haven for terrorists escaped from [LOC Afghanistan] and permitting increasing guerrilla attacks in [LOC Kashmir] . 20021228 [MISC Indian] Deputy Prime Minister [PER Lal Krishna Advani] stated at a gathering of paramilitary police officers in [LOC New Delhi] -- Intelligence reports state that al-Qaeda members have fled from [MISC American] forces in [LOC Afghanistan] and relocated to western [LOC Pakistan] and [LOC Pakistan-controlled Kashmir] , making [LOC Pakistan] the new epicenter of terrorism . Cross-border incursions by [MISC Islamic] guerrillas into [LOC Indian-controlled Kashmir] increased in recent weeks . The international community must beware of the situation , which could prove expensive for any country . [LOC Pakistan] 's foreign ministry spokesman [PER Aziz Ahmad Khan] stated in [LOC Islamabad] -- The accusations were without merit . [MISC Indian] leaders have previously leveled baseless allegations at [LOC Pakistan] . [LOC India] should resolve its issues with [LOC Pakistan] including the core issue of [LOC Kashmir] to ensure durable peace in the region , rather than accuse [LOC Pakistan] . [LOC India] has refused talks with [LOC Pakistan] . [MISC Pakistani] and [MISC American] officials stated that over 400 [ORG Taliban] and al-Qaeda suspects have been arrested in [LOC Pakistan] . 20021228 the head of the [MISC Pakistan-based] guerrilla group Hezb-ul [MISC Mujahadeen] [PER Syed Salahuddin] stated at a meeting of [ORG Hezb] commanders in mazzafarabad , the capital of [MISC Pakistani] [LOC Kashmir] , that [ORG Hezb] will continue and increase jihad in the [MISC Indian] state of [LOC Jammu-Kashmir] with full force . [ORG Hezb] is the largest of over 12 militias battling [MISC Indian] troops for [LOC Kashmir] 's independence from mostly [LOC Hindu] [LOC India] , or its merger with [LOC Islamic] [LOC Pakistan] . [PER Advani] stated -- [MISC Pakistani] President [PER Pervez Musharraf] 's assurance to the [LOC United States] of ending cross-border terrorism in [LOC Kashmir] , terminating militant camps and banning dozens of [MISC Islamic] groups was merely cosmetic . Many of the banned terrorist groups continued activity in [LOC Pakistan] and [LOC Kashmir] under new names . The [MISC Indian] army stated that 4 [MISC Islamic] militants were killed in 2 separate gun battles 20021228 . [MISC Indian] army spokesman Lt.Col . [PER Mukhtar Singh] stated that soldiers stormed a militant hideout in [LOC Kreeri] , a village 35 kilometers north of [LOC Srinagar] , [LOC Jammu-Kashmir] 's summer capital . 2 militants identified as members of the [MISC Pakistan-based] [ORG Lashkar-e-Tayyaba] group were killed .

[LOC India] and [LOC Pakistan] have fought 2 of 3 wars over control of [LOC Kashmir] . Both countries claim the entirety of the region . The [MISC Islamic] insurgency in [LOC Kashmir] has lasted 13 years and killed over 61000 people . [LOC India] accuses [LOC Pakistan] of funding and training the cross-border guerrillas . [LOC Pakistan] claims it offers moral rather than material support to the rebels , whom it considers freedom fighters . 2003-01-25 [LOC Thailand] ( [LOC TH] ) ; [LOC Japan] ( JP ) ; [LOC Malaysia] ( MY ) ; [LOC Philippines] ( PH ) ; [LOC Korea] , [LOC Republic] of ( KR ) ; [LOC India] ( IN ) International ; technology ; Telecom ; business ; crime A virus-like computer infection spread through [MISC Asian] digital networks and disrupted [MISC Internet] services in several countries . The virus is thought to have utilized a security flaw in microsoft software . A virus-like computer infection spread through worldwide digital networks and interrupted [MISC Internet] service in parts of [LOC Asia] on 25 January 2003 . The infection slowed or halted web browsing and e-mail services in several countries . Users and news media reported outages or slowdowns in [LOC Thailand] , [LOC Japan] , [LOC Malaysia] , the [LOC Philippines] , [LOC South Korea] and [LOC India] . [MISC Internet] service providers said a sudden surge in traffic jammed networks on the afternoon of 25 January 2003 . Antivirus vendor [ORG Symantec Corp.] estimated at least 22000 systems were affected worldwide . A technical support representative for [MISC Internet] [LOC Thailand] stated -- A virus or worm attacked a bug in microsoft software . While traffic among domestic [MISC Thai] servers was normal , exchanges with international servers began slowing down around 12:00 pm ( 0500 [MISC GMT] ) . The exchanges came to a halt within hours before recovering the evening of 25 January 2003 . [LOC U.S.] officials stated the attack sought out vulnerable computers on the [MISC Internet] using a known flaw in software from [ORG Microsoft Corp.] called [ORG SQL] server 2000 . The attacking software code scanned for victim computers randomly and aggressively and sent out thousands of probes each second which overwhelmed many [MISC Internet] data pipelines . Local [MISC Thai] subscribers stated that other [MISC Thai] [MISC Internet] service providers appeared to be unaffected . [ORG NHK] television in [LOC Japan] reported -- Some of the [LOC Japan] 's [MISC Internet] connections experienced heavy traffic . A public university computer had been hit by over 200000 transmissions in 1 hour . Security firms were investigating the incident . Traffic-directing computers at [ORG Korea Telecom] freetel and [ORG SK Telecom] failed to function in [LOC South Korea] and affected millions of [MISC Internet] users . Chief system engineer at [LOC KT] freetel [PER Kim Chang-Rae] stated excessive traffic caused 1 of [LOC KT] freetel 's main domain servers to fail which forced other servers to shut down in a chain reaction . Officials stated the system was restored after several hours but service remained slow . The failure affected weekend [MISC Internet] banking and shopping traffic ahead of the [ORG Lunar] [MISC New Year] holiday . [ORG Chunghwa Telecom Co] . [ORG Ltd.] is 1 of the largest [MISC Internet] providers in [LOC Taiwan] . A customer service operator from [ORG Chunghwa Telecom Co] . [ORG Ltd.] stated service experienced difficulties and that some customers weren't able to access the web . The operator would not state how many customers were affected . Privately-owned [MISC Internet] service provider timedotcom in [LOC Malaysia] stated timedotcom had received numerous complaints from customers of partial or no access to the [MISC Internet] . [MISC Internet] users in [LOC New Delhi] reported service interruptions but no problems were reported in [LOC India] 's software development centers of [LOC Hyderabad] and [LOC Bangalore] . [MISC Internet] service provider sky [ORG Internet Inc.] in the [LOC Philippines] reported an increase in signals early on 25 January 2003 and stated the increase was an apparent attempt to congest the network . Sky [ORG Internet Inc.] workers temporarily shut down dial-up service in response to the increase in signals . Technical operator at Sky [ORG Internet Inc] . [PER Dan Rebueno] stated several signals came from an outside source that workers at Sky [ORG Internet Inc.] could not identify and the Workers blocked the congestion attempts . [PER Rebueno] stated sky [ORG Internet Inc.] is currently up on a normal workload . Officials in the [LOC United States] said the attack on 25 January 2003 bore similarities to a [MISC Code Red] virus in the summer of 2001 which also halted traffic on much of the [MISC Internet] . In May 2000 the so-called love bug virus was released in the [LOC Philippines] and overwhelmed e-mail systems worldwide . The virus caused 10s of millions of dollars in damage . Prosecutors in the [LOC Philippines] dismissed all charges against a man accused of releasing the virus because of a lack of applicable laws . 2003-04-06 [LOC Philippines] ( PH ) ; [LOC United States] ( [LOC US] ) ; [LOC Singapore] ( [ORG SG] ) International ; terrorism [ORG Philippine intelligence] reports reveal [MISC Singapore-based] al-Qaida group 's plans to bomb embassies , [LOC U.S.] corporations , and warships in [LOC Singapore] and to crash hijacked planes at [LOC Singapore] 's [LOC National Airport] . The plans were successfully stopped in their final stages in December 2001 and 15 cell members were arrested . [ORG Philippine intelligence] reports obtained by the [ORG Associated Press] reveal a [MISC Singapore-based] al-Qaida group 's plans to attack embassies of the [LOC United States] , [LOC Great Britain] , [LOC Israel] and [LOC Australia] , to attack [LOC U.S.] corporations and warships in [LOC Singapore] and to crash a hijacked plane at the country 's international airport . The group ordered a chemist to buy 4 tons of ammonium nitrate . The amount is 4 times the amount of explosive that [PER Timothy McVeigh] used to bomb the [LOC Oklahoma City] Federal Building . The embassy attacks were successfully stopped in the final stages by [LOC U.S.] investigators and allies in [LOC Southeast Asia] but the explosives were not recovered . 1 of the phillipine reports states that [LOC Singapore] is a target for terrorist attacks because of its 17000 [LOC U.S.] residents and 6000 multinational companies including several [MISC American] companies . The terrorists belonged to [ORG Jemaah Islamiah] designated by the [LOC U.S.] government as a terrorist organization and described in 1 of the phillipine reports as part of the broader al-Qaida syndicate . The group planned attacks in [LOC Singapore] before and after the hijackings in the [LOC United States] on 11 September 2001 . The group is believed responsible for attacks throughout [LOC Southeast Asia] . The group is suspected in the bombings in [LOC Bali] that killed approximately 200 people in October 2002 . The attacks in [LOC Singapore] were prevented after 15 individuals were arrested in December 2001 . 2 of the individuals arrested were released . 1 of the [MISC Philippine] reports stated that local officials and [MISC Western] business executives were shocked by the ability of [ORG Al-Qaida] to plant operatives in such a tightly controlled society as [LOC Singapore] . The members of the 4 or 5-man terror cells led normal lives and avoided contact with known [MISC Islamic] organizations . The members were not known to be active members of mosques in [LOC Singapore] . In efforts to avoid detection the members used code names and code numbers , communicated by e-mail , encrypted their computer diskettes and used prepaid mobile phone cards . Investigators stated that after the [LOC U.S.] military campaign began in [LOC Afghanistan] members of [ORG Jemaah Islamiah] planned to procure 21 tons of explosive materials and bought 4 tons of ammonium nitrate in an operation to attack embassies in [LOC Singapore] . The ammonium nitrate was purchased by captured [MISC Malaysian] chemist and retired army captain [PER Yazid Sufaat] . Authorities state that [PER Sufaat] hosted 11 September hijackers and the accused terrorism suspect [PER Zacarias Moussaoui] in [LOC Malaysia] at different times in 2000 . Authorities state that [PER Sufaat] provided [PER Moussaoui] with counterfeit documents with which to enter the [LOC United States] . [PER Moussaoui] was arrested in August 2001 in [LOC Minnesota] and remains the only [LOC U.S.] defendant indicted as a conspirator with the perpetrators of the 11 September attacks . The [MISC Singaporean] cell members were believed to be conducting reconnaissance when they were apprehended . The explosive materials were sent to an [MISC Indonesian] island off [LOC Singapore] . During the attack planning an [MISC Indonesian] and a [MISC Kuwaiti] arrived in [LOC Singapore] with instructions for the embassy operations . Cell members guided them to the [LOC U.S.] embassy which was videotaped including close-up shots . The adjoining [MISC Australian] embassy was also videotaped . In a separate plot a member of the cell took digital photographs of [LOC U.S.] military aircraft and personnel using [LOC Singapore] 's [LOC Paya Lebar] air base . [LOC Singapore] authorities believe a cell leader traveled to [LOC Afghanistan] and briefed al-Qaida leaders about the proposed shuttle bus attack between August 1999 and April 2000 . The al-Qaida officials apparently turned down the plan because the target was not large enough . A few days after the [LOC Singapore] arrests in December 2001 a videotape was found in an abandoned house in [LOC Kabul] , [LOC Afghanistan] in which a narrator describes locations in [LOC Singapore] where bombs could be hidden to attack [MISC Americans] . Investigators searched the homes of those detained in [LOC Singapore] and found an identical videotape . The [LOC Singapore] wing of [ORG Jemaah Islamiah] may also have [MISC Thai] connections since at least 5 members who eluded the 2001 arrests fled to [LOC Thailand] . 1 of the reports stated -- The group had previously plotted to conduct 7 simultaneous explosions in different areas of [LOC Singapore] . The Group had further planned to hijack a [LOC U.S.] , [MISC British] or [MISC Singaporean] plane and crash it into [ORG Changi Airport] in order to threaten the [LOC U.S.] government to halt its military strikes against [LOC Afghanistan] . In February 2003 [MISC Indonesian] police announced the arrest of the alleged head of the cell in [LOC Singapore] Mas Selamat Kastari who was suspected of planning the airport attack . Kastari also was suspected in the proposed shuttle bus attack . The reports arose after intelligence agents from [LOC Southeast Asian] countries realized after the 11 September 2001 attacks that many radical [MISC Islamic] groups in the region had close connections to each other and to [PER Osama bin Laden] 's terrorist network . 2003-04-28 [LOC India] ( IN ) ; [LOC France] ( [ORG FR] ) International ; Government ; technology ; military ; money The defense ministers of [LOC France] and [LOC India] met April 28 , 2003 to discuss how [LOC India] can improve defense technology with [LOC France] 's guidance . [LOC India] is expected to close multiple deals with [LOC France] soon regarding the purchase of military equipment . Government representatives of [LOC India] and [LOC France] stated April 28 , 2003 that the 2 countries are making progress on [LOC India] 's plans to purchase French-made submarines and military aircraft . [MISC French] Defense Minister [PER Michele Alliot-Marie] stated after talks with [MISC Indian] Defense Minister [PER George Fernandez] that the defense partnership between [LOC India] and [LOC France] is exemplary in intensity and diversity . [PER Michele Alliot-Marie] completed a 3-day visit to [LOC India] on April 28 , 2003 .

[PER Michele Alliot-Marie] stated that [LOC India] is considering many new contracts for [MISC French] submarines , military aircraft and other defense equipment . [LOC India] and [LOC France] will soon conclude a 2 billion dollar agreement to build 6 Scorpene submarines in [LOC India] under a technology transfer deal . The deal is still awaiting final approval by the [ORG Indian Cabinet Committee] on Security . The deal would allow the submarines to be supplied to the [MISC Indian] Navy between 2010 and 2015 . The submarines would be armed with French-made Exocet anti-ship missiles . [PER Michele Alliot-Marie] stated that talks are likely to result in the successful completion of the deal by the end of 2003 . The [MISC Indian] [ORG Air Force] is considering buying 130 multi-role fighter planes to replace its aging [MISC Soviet-made] [MISC MiG] aircraft . [LOC France] has been attempting to sell [MISC Mirage-V] fighter jets to [LOC India] for 5 years . Defense deals take years to conclude in [LOC India] because every agreement must be approved by several ministries and can be stalled by opposition parties . [PER Michele Alliot-Marie] stated that the 2 sides in the [MISC Indian] government have the competence and equivalent interests in defense cooperation and that the two sides must work together for deals to be completed . The governments of [LOC India] and [LOC France] share the position that the [ORG United Nations] should lead efforts for the physical reconstruction of [LOC Iraq] and that the political reconstruction of [LOC Iraq] should be the responsibility of the local people . [PER Michele Alliot-Marie] stated that it is critical that [MISC Iraqi] people take charge of the political restructuring of [LOC Iraq] . 2003-05-08 [LOC Pakistan] ( PK ) ; [LOC Iran] ( [MISC Islamic] Republic of ) ( [ORG IR] ) International ; politics ; crime ; Government ; narcotics ; human rights Officials from [LOC Pakistan] and [LOC Iran] meet to discuss efforts against cross-border drug smuggling and human trafficking at the beginning of annual security talks .

[MISC Taiwanese] Vice President [PER Annette Lu] warned on 040212 that the transfer of [MISC European] technology to the [ORG People 's] [LOC Republic of China] could encourage the [LOC PRC] government to invade [LOC Taiwan] . [PER Lu] noted that the [ORG European Union] adopted a resolution to ban arms sales to mainland [LOC China] after the Tiananmen massacre of 890000 and said it is worrisome that the leaders of [LOC France] and [LOC Germany] are reportedly seeking to lift the ban following years of commercial interest enticements by the [LOC PRC] government . [PER Lu] expressed concern that [MISC European] advanced technology will be transferred to the mainland and added that such transfers would be helpful for the [LOC PRC] government 's military buildup and will therefore encourage an invasion of [LOC Taiwan] by the mainland . [PER Lu] said that the government of mainland [LOC China] has tried to isolate [LOC Taiwan] diplomatically and has been increasing its military buildup against [LOC Taiwan] . [PER Lu] said the [LOC PRC] government has deployed around 500 missiles targeting [LOC Taiwan] and the number of missiles deployed is expected to increase to 650 next year . [PER Lu] described the [LOC PRC] government as a real international terrorist because of the threat of missiles aimed at [LOC Taiwan] and the [LOC PRC] 's preparations to invade [LOC Taiwan] . [PER Lu] added that this is why [MISC Taiwanese] President [PER Chen Shui-bian] called for a peace referendum for 040320 alongside the [MISC Taiwanese] presidential election . [PER Lu] said [MISC European] nations should not join the [LOC PRC] government in opposing [LOC Taiwan] 's planned referendum . [PER Lu] said that [LOC Taiwan] is not a part of the [ORG People 's] [LOC Republic of China] and has maintained substantive relations with almost all countries around the world even though most of them do not have diplomatic relations with [LOC Taiwan] . [LOC Taiwan] has never ceased making efforts to participate in international activities and has made great contributions to global development despite being refused membership by many international organizations .

A delegation of [MISC Taiwanese] legislators completed an 11-day fact-finding trip to the [LOC United States] . The [LOC Taiwan] Executive Yuan submitted a [LOC NT] $610.8 billion ( [LOC US] $18.23 billion ) special budget to buy 388 [MISC Patriot] PAC-III missiles , 8 conventional submarines and 12 [MISC P-3] C anti-submarine aircraft from the [LOC United States] earlier this month . The budget is now pending approval by the [ORG Legislative Yuan] . [PER Ker Chien-ming] , the [ORG Democratic Progressive Party] ( [ORG DPP] ) whip at the [LOC Taiwan] legislature said on 040628 that discussions are turning negative in regard to whether the [ORG China Shipbuilding Corp] . ( [ORG CSBC] ) should take part in the construction of submarines which the [LOC United States] has promised to sell to [LOC Taiwan] . Navy Commander-in-Chief Miao Yung-Ching called on the [ORG Legislative Yuan] to communicate on the review of the arms procurement budget of which the submarine deal is a part . Miao said it is not feasible for [ORG CSBC] to take part in the construction of the submarines and that the Navy will negotiate with the [LOC United States] on obtaining repair capacity and technology transfers . Miao said that no countries want to buy conventional submarines . This would make it futile to give the [ORG CSBC] the capacity to build them . The [LOC United States] has control of the key technology in building the submarines . [PER Lee Wen-chung] is another [ORG DPP] legislator who has been involved . [PER Lee] said on 040628 that the delegation asked the [LOC United States] to shorten the delivery period of the submarines from 15 years to 10 years . This indicates that [LOC Taiwan] has already given up the policy of building the submarines itself . [PER Lee] said that if the submarines are not built by [LOC Taiwan] then the cost of the eight subs will be [LOC NT] $100 billion less than the original plan of [LOC NT] $400 billion . [PER Lee] 's figures were based on the price tags of submarines sold from [LOC Germany] and [LOC Spain] along with the cost of obtaining repair capacity . [PER Lee] was asked if the long delivery period of 10 years might affect [LOC Taiwan] 's military strength and tip the military cross-Taiwan Strait balance toward mainland [LOC China] after 050000 . [PER Lee] answered that any possible naval military balance tilting toward the [LOC PRC] after 050000 would not mean an eruption of war at that time . [PER Lee] claimed that [LOC Taiwan] still enjoys the edge in the air . [PER Lee] added that an order of Kidd-class destroyers due to arrive at [LOC Taiwan] by the end of next year would allow [LOC Taiwan] to still maintain its edge . [PER Lee] also said that the [LOC United States] will deliver the first 5 of 12 [MISC P-3] C aircraft in 080000 , with another 3 in 090000 , 4 in 100000 and the final 4 in 110000 . 1995-12-18 [LOC Germany] ( [LOC DE] ) International ; weapons ; war and conflict The process to try to control and reduce arms in the embattled [LOC Balkans] was formally launched in [LOC Bonn] , [LOC Germany] , when foreign ministers , ambassadors and representatives of international organizations and observer nations met to discuss what form further talks should take . The long process to try to control and reduce arms in the embattled [LOC Balkans] was formally launched on 951218 in [LOC Bonn] , [LOC Germany] . Foreign ministers , ambassadors and representatives of international organizations and observer nations met in [LOC Bonn] to discuss what form further talks should take . There are huge obstacles to achieving peace and cooperation among combatants in the former [LOC Yugoslavia] . [MISC German] Foreign Minister [PER Klaus Kinkel] said in opening remarks at the one-day meeting that there can be no peace in the former [LOC Yugoslavia] if some parties to the conflict remain heavily armed and others try to catch up . The [MISC Croation] delegation threatened to pull out of arms-reduction negotiations if certain demands were not met in the nearest future . Delegates from other countries called on [LOC Croatia] , [LOC Bosnia-Herzegovina] and [LOC Serbia] to set aside their grievances and learn to compromise . [MISC Croatian] Foreign Minister [PER Mate Granic] complained that a part of [MISC Croatian] territory is under occupation and time is running out . [PER Granic] said in reference to disputed lands on the [MISC Croatian-Serbian] border that the peaceful re-integration of [LOC Eastern Slavonia] is the key to the lasting stability in the region and that everyone faces the danger of another round of hostilities and the destabilization of the whole region and highly unpredictable consequences for [LOC Bosnia-Herzegovina] without it . Conference participants said Foreign Minister [PER Milan Milutinovic] from [LOC Serbia] scolded his [MISC Croatian] counterpart for grandstanding . Then [PER Milutinovic] made a threat to pull out of arms-control negotiations . [PER Milutinovic] noted the [MISC Serbian] Government has been suspended since 920000 from the [ORG Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe] and said that unless full membership were restored [LOC Yugoslavia] will be prevented from cooperating despite its readiness to do so . The [ORG OSCE] is to oversee the next round of [LOC Balkan] arms-reduction talks . [PER Michael Williams] is a senior fellow at the International Institute for [MISC Strategic Studies] in [LOC London] and formerly the [LOC United Nations'] senior spokesman for [LOC Croatia] and called the early threats from [LOC Croatia] and [LOC Serbia] a worrying development and an ominous development . [PER Williams] said it was really not clear that the parties are willing to engage in any arms control in a meaningful way . This corresponds to a fear expressed by some delegates to the 951218 [LOC Bonn] meeting that the yugolav parties do not want to negotiate away the ability to use violence or a threat of violence to seize territory . [MISC Greek] Foreign Minister karelos [PER Papoulias] observed of the [LOC Balkan] belligerents that during talk in the plenary session one realizes that this is still the way they are thinking . [PER Papoulias] said the [MISC Greek] government is not as optimistic as other [MISC European] partners and that just because there is a Conference doesn't mean there is friendship between the people of the former [LOC Yugoslavia] . The 951218 talks were organized to fulfill the combatants' pledge made in [LOC Dayton] , [LOC Ohio] , to begin talks to enhance mutual confidence and reduce the risk of conflict within 7 days of the Peace Accord 's formal signing . The agenda on 951218 was limited to set the formal process for coming weeks . The [MISC German] [ORG Foreign Ministry] said in a statement that this was so as to clear the way for speedy negotiation of the substantive questions . [LOC Croatia] , [LOC Bosnia-Herzegovina] and [LOC Serbia] are the nations that signed the [LOC Dayton] accord and are supposed to report how many tanks and armored vehicles , heavy artillery pieces , combat aircraft and attack helicopters they possess in the next phase . This data will be used to establish baselines from which weapons ceilings can be agreed on . [LOC Croatia] , [LOC Bosnia-Herzegovina] and [LOC Serbia] have promised to accept a set of automatic limits if agreement on such ceilings cannot be reached in 180 days . [PER Kinkel] said that on 951218 delegates had been unable to fix a date for the next round of talks but said the next talks would be 960104 or 960107 in [LOC Vienna] . [PER Kinkel] said minor problems not substantive discord kept delegates from choosing a firm date . 1999-06-30 [LOC India] ( IN ) ; [LOC Korea] , [ORG Democratic People 's Republic] of ( [ORG KP] ) International ; technology ; weapons ; government [MISC Indian] officials seize missile assembly line from the [MISC North Korean] vessel the kuwolsan on 30 June 1999 . The discovery heightens suspicions of [MISC North Korean] weapons proliferation . On 30 June 1999 [MISC Indian] customs agents in the northwestern port city of [LOC Kandla] boarded the [MISC North Korean] freighter kuwolsan . Following a melee with the crew of the kuwolsan , customs agents discovered an assembly line for ballistic missiles . [LOC U.S.] intelligence officials stated [MISC Libyan] government was the intended recipient of the cargo . The kuwolsan departed [LOC North Korea] 's [LOC Nampo] harbor on 10 April 1999 . Records show that on 20 April 1999 the kuwolsan made detours to 2 [MISC Thai] ports to pick up 14000 tons of sugar for resale along the way to the kuwolsan 's destination . The kuwolsan switched course in order to sell the sugar to an [MISC Indian] company after a deal to sell the sugar to [MISC Algerians] failed . An [MISC Indian] investigator stated that the crew of the kuwolsan should not have picked up extra cargo at several ports when carrying 200 tons of sensitive equipment and that such activity was crazy . [MISC Indian] customs officials were tipped off to possible contraband on the kuwolsan while the kuwolsan was en route to [LOC Kandla] . The kuwolsan was rumored to be carrying arms or ammunition possibly intended for [LOC Pakistan] . [MISC Indian] port officials were waiting when the kuwolsan arrived in [LOC Kandla] on 25 June 1999 . Irregularities in the kuwolsan 's papers were apparent within the first few hours of investigation . [MISC Indian] officials learned that the company in [LOC Malta] listed as the intended recipient of the cargo was fictitious . [MISC Indian] officials questioned why anyone in [LOC Malta] would choose to buy water refining equipment from [LOC North Korea] when [LOC Malta] is a short flight from [LOC Europe] . [MISC Indian] customs agents questioned the captain of the kuwolsan [PER Tae Min Hun] . [PER Tae] blocked every request and threatened international reprisals if [MISC Indian] officials did not allow [PER Tae] to leave [LOC Kandla] . On 30 June 1999 customs officials demanded to search the kuwolsan 's cargo boxes and [PER Tae] stated that the kuwolsan had received a telex from [MISC North Korean] officials . [PER Tae] received instructions from officials in [LOC Pyongyang] to allow no one to open the cargo boxes at all costs . The official [MISC Indian] after-action report stated [PER Tae] would not open any more boxes as per the telex . The report stated the crew members shouted at and abused the customs officers . According to witness accounts and video footage of the encounter , tae and the crew of the kuwolsan barricaded the doors of the kuwolsan with the crews' bodies . An [MISC Indian] official who was present on the kuwolsan and who spoke on the condition of anonymity stated the situation became physical and there were fisticuffs . The official stated the crew began closing the hatches to the cargo hold with the customs inspectors still inside . On 1 July 1999 armed troops and a group of government weapons experts aided customs officials and gained forcible entry onto the kuwolsan . A few crates among the kuwolsan 's cargo contained equipment that could be used in a water treatment plant . Inspectors found pumps , nozzles and a few valves . The cargo boxes were labeled as water refinement equipment . Documents from the investigation contain a partial list of the contents of most of the cargo crates which included -- Components for missile subassembly . [ORG Machine Tools] for setting up a fabrication facility . Instrumentation for evaluating the performance of a full missile system . Equipment for calibrating missile components . Rocket nose cones , stacks of metal pipe and heavy-duty presses used for milling high-grade steel . A Plate-bending machine capable of rolling thick metal sheets , toroidal air bottles used to guide warheads after separation from a missile , and Theodolites that measure missile trajectories . Several boxes of engineering drawings , blueprints , notebooks , textbooks and reports . Personal items presumably intended for [MISC North Korean] workers , including cookbooks in [MISC Korean] , [MISC Korean] spices , pickles and acupuncture sets . An [MISC Indian] government official familiar with the kuwolsan discovery stated that in the past officials had seen missiles or engine parts , but here was an entire assembly line for missiles offered for sale . The official stated that this was a complete technology transfer . A technical committee of [MISC Indian] missile experts stated that the equipment was unimpeachable and irrefutable evidence of a plan to transfer not just missiles but missile-making capability . The technical panel wrote in a report that the cargo points to only one end-use , namely the assembling of missiles and manufacture of the parts and subassemblies of surface to surface missiles . Investigators searched the blueprints that were kept inside numbered plastic jackets and wrapped in brown paper . Some of the packets were labeled in [MISC English] as [MISC Scud B] or [MISC Scud] [PER C. Nearly] all of the drawings showed rockets or sections of rockets with notes and mathematical formulas handwritten in [MISC Korean] . [MISC Native Korean] speakers assisted in translation but the documents contained technical code invented by [MISC North Korean] scientists to replace scientific terms in [MISC Russian] or [MISC Chinese] . The investigation ultimately yielded information about [LOC North Korea] 's weapons program which [MISC Indian] authorities shared with ally Governments . The [MISC Scud B] and [MISC Scud] C designs found on the kuwolsan were from older [MISC North Korean] missile programs which were derived from [MISC Soviet] missile designs of the 1950s . One [MISC Indian] government official who studied the blueprints stated the science was old and dated but still functional . Retired director of the [ORG State Department] 's Office on strategic , proliferation and military issues in the [ORG Bureau of Intelligence and Research] [PER Greg Thielmann] stated the [ORG CIA] utilized the blueprints to make full mock-ups of missiles complete with decals . The blueprints included information pertaining to the inner workings of [LOC North Korea] 's missile industry which has been the focus of contention between the [LOC United States] and [LOC North Korea] since the 1980s . The cargo on the kuwolsan did not include everything needed for missile production which raises the possibility that there may have been earlier and possible later shipments . Missile expert and senior analyst at the Center for [ORG Nonproliferation Studies] [PER Timothy V. McCarthy] examined some of the blueprints and other evidence and stated this was a slice in time of a technology transfer from [LOC North Korea] to [LOC Libya] . [PER McCarthy] stated the intelligence find helps [LOC U.S.] officials learn how [MISC North Korean] missile scientists learn . [PER McCarthy] stated the information gives [LOC U.S.] officials an idea of how capable [MISC North Korean] scientists are of progressing to more advanced missiles and gives [LOC U.S.] officials insight into the aspect of proliferation when one country 's officials attempt to transfer technology to another country 's officials . [PER McCarthy] stated no one can stop [MISC Libyan] scientists once the scientists are capable of making missiles . The kuwolsan and the crew were unaccounted for after [MISC Indian] officials released the kuwolsan in 2000 . Shipping experts at [PER Lloyd] 's maritime division in [LOC London] stated the kuwolsan 's name was changed in the summer of 2000 to [ORG Sun] grisan 9 . As of the week of 3 August 2003 the sun grisan 9 was still in service and was last reported headed to the [MISC Somalian] capital of [LOC Mogadishu] . The nature of the [ORG Sun] grisan 9 's cargo was unknown . As of 14 August 2003 the evidence from the kuwolsan is secured in a military warehouse in [LOC New Delhi] . As stated in court documents and interviews with officials in the [LOC United States] and [LOC India] the kuwolsan incident has reinforced a view of [LOC North Korea] as the world 's most dangerous source of weapons proliferation . In 1999 [MISC North Korean] leader [PER Kim Jong Il] expelled [ORG U.N.] inspectors , abandoned the [MISC Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty] and declared plans to build an atomic weapon . [LOC U.S.] intelligence officials stated that [MISC North Korean] officials are continuing global trade in technology for weapons of mass destruction including instructions for making advanced missiles . Successive [LOC U.S.] administrations have condemned [LOC North Korea] 's missile sales to such countries as [LOC Iran] and [LOC Syria] . On 31 August 1998 [MISC North Korean] officials launched a 3-stage missile which heightened fears of advanced [MISC North Korean] designs capable of reaching the [LOC U.S.] mainland . The first stage splashed down in the [LOC Sea] of [LOC Japan] , the second stage crossed the main island of [LOC Japan] and the third broke up and traveled 3450 miles downrange and fell into the [LOC Pacific Ocean] . The missile test fueled work on a [LOC U.S.] missile defense shield . [MISC North Korean] officials have defended the right to sell weapons and have stated that [MISC North Korean] officials are not bound by international treaties restricting such trade . [MISC North Korean] officials have sold missiles and parts to [LOC Yemen] which received 15 [MISC Scud] missiles after the missiles were briefly intercepted by [LOC U.S.] and [MISC Spanish] naval crews off the [MISC Yemeni] coast in December 1998 . [LOC Libya] appears to be the latest beneficiary of [MISC North Korean] weapons . Other nations including [LOC Iran] , [LOC Pakistan] and [LOC Syria] are known to have received similar help . The kuwolsan cargo attests to the existence of a gray zone composed of a combination of weak [LOC States] , open borders , lack of controls and a market of buyers and sellers of weapons of mass destruction . Small packages are sometimes delivered in the luggage of individual airline passengers such as a [MISC Taiwanese] businessman arrested at [LOC Zurich] 's airport in 2000 with [MISC North Korean] missile parts in a rucksack . Larger items are moved in freighters such as the kuwolsan while technical information and designs are accessible via the [MISC Internet] . [LOC Korea] specialist with the Center for [ORG Nonproliferation Studies] at the [ORG Monterey Institute of International Studies] in [LOC California] [PER Daniel pinkston] stated that intercepting weapons and equipment is difficult but not impossible but that human exchanges of plans , data , and intellectual property are difficult to intercept . 2002-04-06 [MISC Russian Federation] ( [MISC RU] ) International ; science ; energy ; weapons A high-security [MISC Russian] laboratory complex storing anthrax , plague and other deadly bacteria faces loosing electricity for lack of payment to the mosenergo electric utility . A large repository of anthrax , plague and other deadly bacteria stored in a high-security [MISC Russian] laboratory complex 100 miles south of [LOC Moscow] is facing the threat of loosing electricity . An official from the [LOC Moscow] region 's mosenergo electric utility arrived recently at the [MISC Russian] laboratory complex and threatened to turn off the electricity for lack of payment . The [MISC Russian] laboratory complex is a 90-building campus and served as the location for [LOC Russia] 's secret biological weapons program in the [MISC Soviet] era . An incorrect headline in the newspaper [ORG Izvestia] stated that deadly viruses from a [LOC Moscow] regional depository threaten [LOC Moscow] . There are no viruses at the [ORG State Scientific Center] of applied Microbiology in obolensk . At the [ORG State Scientific Center] of applied microbiology there is every kind of deadly bacteria that was studied for use in the secret biological weapons program of the [LOC Soviet Union] . A large virus repository is located in [LOC Siberia] . Both [MISC Russian] and [MISC Western] officials have stated that it is unlikely that any public health threat would result from a power cutoff at the [ORG State Scientific Center] of applied microbiology . [MISC Russian] and [MISC Western] officials have stated that there is enough uncertainty that they could not be positive a loss of power at the [ORG State Scientific Center] of applied microbiology would not cause a public health threat . General [PER Nikolai N. Urakov] stated by telephone that the [ORG State Scientific Center] of applied microbiology has quite reliable systems of protection in case of emergency . General [PER Nikolai N. Urakov] is the longtime director of the the [ORG State Scientific Center] of applied microbiology . The [ORG State] scientific center of applied microbiology has been working with [MISC Western] scientists to convert the complex into a biomedical manufacturing site . General [PER Nikolai N. Urakov] stated by telephone that the people at the [ORG State Scientific Center] of applied microbiology are scared by this threat of a sudden shutdown of electricity because it is a kind of psychological pressure on the people at the [ORG State Scientific Center] of applied microbiology . General [PER Nikolai N. Urakov] stated by telephone that in the event of a power shutdown at the [ORG State Scientific Center] of applied microbiology scientists must destroy all bacteriological experiments under way . General [PER Nikolai N. Urakov] would like the [LOC United States] and [MISC Western] countries that have contributed about 6 million [LOC United States] dollars to the transformation of the former bioweapons complex to contribute another 500000 [LOC United States] dollars per year to pay the [ORG State Scientific Center] of applied microbiology 's electric bills and arrears . An [MISC American] scientist who works closely with the [ORG State Scientific Center] of applied microbiology stated that the [MISC Russian] government was responsible for paying for the [ORG State Scientific Center] of applied microbiology 's electric bills . [MISC Western] aid for conversion of General [PER Nikolai N. Urakov] 's one time bioweapons laboratory peaked in 970000 because it was learned that [LOC Iran] had made offers to the [ORG State Scientific Center] of applied microbiology to purchase its expertise . [MISC Russian] scientists and military leaders who now depend on [MISC Western] financing to destroy nuclear , chemical and biological weapons have been known to orchestrate a sense of crisis to increase financing . [MISC American] scientist [PER Randall Lee Beatty] is working on the conversion of the [ORG State Scientific Center] of applied Microbiology in obolensk . [PER Beatty] stated that this threat to cut electricity to the [ORG State Scientific Center] of applied microbiology is a crisis . [PER Randall Lee Beatty] is a Director of the [ORG International Science and Technology Center] . The [ORG International Science and Technology Center] finances approximately half of General [PER Nikolai N. Urakov] 's budget to support about 350 [MISC Russian] biowarfare scientists and technicians . [PER Randall Lee Beatty] stated that it is known that the [ORG State Scientific Center] of applied microbiology has not paid its electricity bill for 14 months . [PER Randall Lee Beatty] stated that the [ORG State Scientific Center] of applied microbiology is one of the important archives for dangerous pathogens in the world and it would be a shame if those archives were destroyed for not paying the electricity utility . Approximately 3000 strains of bacteria are stored at the [ORG State Scientific Center] of applied microbiology and many of the bacteria are stored in cryogenic casks cooled with liquid nitrogen and isolated from the environment by layered enclosures and oversize air-handling systems that all depend on electricity to function . The greatest danger from a shutdown of electric power at the [ORG State Scientific Center] of applied microbiology would be the defrosting of live germs that are currently preserved in a frozen state . A biological warfare expert at the [ORG Monterey Institute of International Studies] named [PER Raymond zilinskas] stated that the main threat from cutting power to the [ORG State Scientific Center] of applied microbiology would be to the organisms themselves rather than that they might escape . [PER Raymond zilinskas] stated that in the worst case the bacteria would be defrosted from minus 70 degrees and it would be a real mess to clean up afterward because it would not be known for certain whether all the bacteria was dead . The confrontation between the mosenergo electric utility and the [ORG State Scientific Center] of applied Microbiology in obolensk is another example of how the basic capitalist imperative for enterprises to be self-sustaining can clash in a dangerous way with the old remnants of [MISC Soviet] weapons science . Due to an overdue power bill in 000000 the [MISC Russian] [ORG National Power Company] cut off electricity to a strategic base where nuclear missiles stood on high alert . The nuclear missile silos themselves did not lose power . Armed troops marched to the substations and turned the power back on . In 010100 and 010200 the national utility , [MISC United] energy systems cut power to a number of military installations around [LOC Russia] . The military installations that lost power included the [MISC Russian] space forces monitoring center on the [ORG Kamchatka Peninsula] . In most cases of military installations having their electricity cut off the electricity has been quickly restored . Often investigations show that the tug of war with the utility forces the military to spend budgeted funds for electrical power instead of diverting money for other uses . Some of the budgeted funds cut at times have included the building country residences for generals . 2004-07-24 [LOC Brazil] ( [ORG BR] ) International ; crime ; Government ; narcotics [LOC Brazil] to implement law allowing air force to target drug trafficking aircraft in [MISC Brazilian] airspace . [LOC US] concerned over liability in the event of misidentification of a civilian plane . [LOC Brazil] announced that the air force will begin shooting down aircraft used in trafficking illegal drugs in [MISC Brazilian] airspace . The plan requires 8 precautionary steps before the order to shoot down a plane may be issued . Prior to the policy taking effect late 20041000 a publicity campaign will notify ranchers and others of the need to file flight plans . The Law to permit such an action was originally approved in 1998 but 1995-2003 President [PER Fernando Henrique Cardoso] never put the policy into effect . The [LOC United States] dissuaded [PER Cardoso] from signing the decree out of concern that the accidental downing of civilian aircraft could expose the [LOC US] government and companies to lawsuits . 20010400 the [LOC United States] reduced previous support for operations targeting drug-running aircraft when a [MISC Peruvian] jet shot down a small plane misidentified as a drug carrier and killed an [MISC American] missionary and her child . Relatives of the victims sued the [LOC US] government and won a settlement due to the Government 's provision of intelligence and technical support to the operation . A [ORG US State Department] official stated -- [LOC US] law may forbid assistance to countries that implement shoot-down laws under certain conditions . The [LOC US] agrees with the [MISC Brazilian] assessment that the threat posed by drug traffickers is both very serious and increasing . The [LOC US] government has consulted the [MISC Brazilian] Government about the provisions of [LOC US] law . [MISC Brazilian] Defense Minister [PER Jose Viegas] stated that [LOC Brazil] has encountered difficulties in securing [LOC US] support for the plan but recent bilateral talks led to certainty that the decree would be accepted by the [LOC US] government without exposing [LOC Brazil] to commercial sanctions . [MISC Brazilian] officials have expressed hope that the policy will be endorsed by the [LOC US] before going into effect . The [LOC US] is scheduled to provide 10.2 million dollars in drug and law enforcement aid to [LOC Brazil] in 2004 . Former air force chief and current Director of the [ORG Air Institute] at estacio de sa University in [LOC Rio de Janeiro] General [PER Mauro Jose Miranda gandra] stated that the measure was a courageous step by the Government but the impact may be more political than practical because of self-imposed restrictions by the [MISC Brazilian] government . [MISC Brazilian] officials stated that the policy would be inapplicable against aircraft with children on board . [PER Viegas] stated that the limitation was necessary . [LOC Gandra] stated that the provision undermines the decree 's essential purpose by granting immunity to drug-smuggling aircraft carrying children and thus introducing the possibility of kidnapped children being used as human shields . [PER Viegas] stated in an interview in [LOC Brasilia] that the government will use the law to more powerfully dissuade drug traffickers who have previously entered [MISC Brazilian] airspace feeling unthreatened by the air force . The Government was prompted to act due to the deteriorating public security situation with increasingly powerful and violent drug gangs in [LOC Sao Paolo] and particularly [LOC Rio de Janeiro] . [LOC Rio de Janeiro] drug gangs have more firepower than the police and have successfully attacked police stations and forced businesses and schools to close . President [PER Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva] stated in a 2003 interview with foreign correspondents -- The policy is a matter of national sovereignty and security . Some pilots of drug-running aircraft felt so confidently immune from retribution as to make obscene gestures at pursuing [MISC Brazilian] air force pilots . The constitutionality of the law has been questioned under [LOC Brazil] 's prohibition of the death penalty as punishment for criminal acts . Some legal experts and other commentators stated that contrary to government claims , the Statute amounts to a de facto execution of drug traffickers . The daily newspaper [LOC O Estado de] [LOC Sao Paolo] stated in an editorial the week of 20040718-20040824 -- the extreme measure raises ethical and juridical problems exceeding any potential benefits . The penalty will be applied extrajudicially by administrative decision of the Commander of the [ORG Air Force] . This person will gain life and death power over crew members and passengers of irregular flights . In 2002 [LOC Brazil] inaugurated the 1.4 billion dollar SIVAM radar system allowing the government to monitor air activity throughout the expansive [LOC Amazon] region for the first time . The system uses [MISC American] technology . Illegal Flights initially declined 30 percent due to trafficker 's concerns about improved tracking capabilities but subsequently reaccelerated . [LOC Brazil] recorded 4128 unauthorized flights in 2003 . Some of these flights were innocent violations by ranchers in the [LOC Amazon] flying between plantations . [PER Viegas] stated that there was a significant increase in deliberate violations of [MISC Brazilian] airspace , apparently by drug smugglers realizing that the government was incapable of retaliation . 20010400 [LOC Rio de Janeiro] 's most notorious drug boss , [PER Fernandinho Beira-Mar] , was captured in [LOC Colombia] in a guns-for drugs pipeline involving left-wing guerrillas . [LOC Brazil] 's northern [LOC Amazon] corridor has become an increasingly busy and essential route in the global drug trade and is used for smuggling arms , gold and diamonds . Reportedly one of the most important drug- and gun-smuggling routes in supplying [LOC Europe] with cocaine runs from [LOC Colombia] across the northern tier of the [LOC Amazon] to [LOC Suriname] . [LOC Colombia] is the only country that currently has a policy of targeting drug trafficking aircraft . [LOC Colombia] is the source of much of the cocaine and heroin sold in the [LOC United States] . 2005-07-16 [LOC Venezuela] ( [ORG VE] ) International ; weapons ; leader ; military The [MISC Venezuelan] president 's weapons deals with [LOC Russia] , curbs on military cooperation with the [LOC United States] , and his plans to train as many as 2 million [MISC Venezuelan] civilians to repel a possible invasion by superpowers have the [LOC US] and his domestic critics worried . [MISC Venezuelan] president [PER Hugo Chavez] 's weapons deals with [LOC Russia] , curbs on military cooperation with the [LOC United States] , and plans to train as many as 2 million [MISC Venezuelan] civilians to repel a possible invasion by imperialist superpowers have the [LOC United States] and [PER Chavez] 's domestic critics worried about what the leftist former military officer is planning . [PER Chavez] insists that the moves are purely defensive and born of an overdue need to update obsolete military hardware and protect [LOC Venezuela] from nations that might want to take control of [LOC Venezuela] . [LOC Venezuela] is [LOC South America] 's largest petroleum-producing state . [PER Chavez] 's domestic opponents scoff at the idea that the [LOC US] would ever invade [LOC Venezuela] and charge that [PER Chavez] 's true intention is to arm a huge cadre of loyal reservists who would protect [PER Chavez] against any internal uprising and to pose as a militarized counterweight to [LOC US] influence in [LOC Latin America] . [MISC Cuban] leader [PER Fidel Castro] is [PER Chavez] 's his major ally and [PER Chavez] is growing closer to [PER Castro] . [PER Chavez] 's detractors in the [LOC US] government say that it is even more troubling that [PER Chavez] 's arms purchases and indoctrination of civilian militias could be part of a strategy to restructure [MISC Venezuelan] democracy in the image of [MISC Cuban-style] militarized socialism and foment leftist revolutions throughout [LOC South America] . [LOC US] military strategists say they are increasingly concerned that radical movements inspired by [PER Chavez] could foment such revolution . The political mainstream in [LOC Latin America] has shifted leftward since the late 1990s . This leftward shift is largely in reaction to the perceived failure of free-market economics . Leftists have been elected to lead [LOC Brazil] , [LOC Argentina] , [LOC Chile] , [LOC Uruguay] , [LOC Ecuador] and [LOC Venezuela] . [PER Chavez] 's supporters at home counter that the [LOC United States] has a century-long history of open as well as covert armed intervention in [LOC Latin America] 's domestic politics and say that it has no right to question [LOC Venezuela] 's defense preparations . [PER Carlos Roque Espinoza Leon] said that [MISC Venezuelans] never ask what the [ORG US Marines] are doing . [PER Espinoza Leon] is a pro-Chavez defense specialist who serves in [LOC Venezuela] 's [ORG National Assembly] . [PER Espinoza] said that [LOC Peru] has 500000 rifles and no one says anything . [PER Espinoza] said no one complains that [LOC Colombia] is the most militarized country in [LOC Latin America] . [PER Espinoza] said [LOC US] history is full of aggression in [LOC Latin America] . [PER Espinoza] said [MISC Venezuelans] have to do whatever is necessary to protect [LOC Venezuela] . [PER Chavez] has famously said that the [MISC Venezuelan] so-called [MISC Bolivarian] revolution is peaceful but not unarmed . [PER Chavez] was first elected in 980000 and has a popularity rating of 71 percent in an independent poll by polling firm [ORG Datanalisis] . [MISC Venezuelan] military analyst [PER Alberto Garrido] said [PER Chavez] is looking for allies in [LOC Russia] , [LOC China] , and [LOC Iran] in order to promote a multi-polar world which will counteract [LOC US] dominance and encourage grassroots Movements in [LOC Latin America] to throw off [LOC US] governmental influence . [PER Lorenzo Campos] is a farmer in [LOC Anzoategui] state in northern [LOC Venezuela] and is training as a reservist . [PER Campos] said [MISC Venezuelans] want the world to know that [MISC Venezuelans] are not preparing to attack anyone and that the mission is to protect [LOC Venezuela] . In May , [PER Chavez] 's government announced details in 050500 of an $18.6 million deal with a [MISC Russian] firm to purchase 100000 [MISC AK-103] assault rifles with 30 rounds of ammunition each and the technology transfer for [LOC Venezuela] to manufacture the rifles . The deal works out to $186.22 per rifle . This price is considerably less costly than the [LOC US] mail-order price of $825 to $850 for the same weapon . The Government of [LOC Venezuela] also intends to buy 10 [MISC Russian] helicopters , 10 [MISC Spanish] transport planes , and 6 [MISC Spanish] naval craft . [MISC Venezuelan] officials say the government is negotiating with [LOC Brazil] to buy around 24 air support and training planes . [PER Chavez] has insisted and even his staunchest retired military Critics here agree that the purchases are essential to update old weaponry such as the military 's decades-old [MISC Belgian] [ORG FAL] rifles . Retired General [PER Fernando OCHOA ANTICH] said that it is an exaggeration to say [PER Chavez] is engaged in an arms buildup . [PER Ochoa] was defense minister in 920000 when then-Lieutenant Colonel [PER Chavez] launched a failed coup . [PER Ochoa] stated that [LOC Venezuela] hasn't purchased arms in 25 years and said and [PER Chavez] is not aggressively buying weapons in a way that would threaten his neighbors . [PER Ochoa] said [LOC Venezuela] has never bought [MISC Russian] arms before and suggested [PER Chavez] is doing it to become independent from the [LOC US] . [PER Ochoa] asked why [PER Chavez] is buying a caliber of rifle which is popular among subversive forces in [LOC Latin America] and stated that the political support [PER Chavez] gives to radical leftist movements makes [PER Chavez] a continental menace . The [LOC US Pentagon] has openly questioned what [PER Chavez] will do with the old [ORG FAL] rifles and whether [PER Chavez] might share weapons or ammunition with guerrilla forces in [LOC Latin America] . The [LOC US] government has provided no evidence of [PER Chavez] arming or funding leftist insurgencies . Military analysts and specialists on the [MISC Colombian] [ORG FARC] guerrillas say the rebels have plenty of money for weapons from drug trafficking and would not be interested in old [MISC Belgian] rifles or in assistance from [PER Chavez] . A 030000 study published by the [ORG US Defense Intelligence Agency] reported that more than half of the weapons seized from [MISC Colombian] guerrillas from 980000 to 010000 that had markings of foreign militaries were of [MISC Venezuelan] origin . The implication was that corrupt or sympathetic members of the [MISC Venezuelan] military may be aiding guerrillas . Perhaps more distressing to [PER Chavez] 's domestic opponents is the ideological training that critics say [PER Chavez] has in mind for the military and for new civilian reservists . [PER Chavez] called earlier in 050000 for so-called Revolutionary units to start preparing the public to resist a superpower aggressor and said the first step would be to train from 100000 to 2 million volunteers in the coming years to back up active-duty armed forces . Military analysts estimate [LOC Venezuela] 's active-duty armed forces number 83,000 . People 's defense units would be created in neighborhoods , State companies , and the [ORG Free University] established under [PER Chavez] and would report directly to the president . The government insists the reserves will support the armed forces and not act as a fifth column against a possible anti-Chavez coup . [PER Espinoza] said the reserves are not to be used as shock troops for any political party and that if there were a civil war , it would be up to each person to take their own side . General [PER Julio Ramon Quintero] viloria is commander of the reserves . [PER Quintero] said in an interview that the armed forces hope to train 50000 civilians over 20 weekends in the second half of 050000 and could train 300000 more in 060000 . [PER Quintero] said that [MISC Venezuelans] don't want to be the colony of any empire and have to be ready for any possibility . 100000 reservists in 050600 engaged with the [MISC Venezuelan] navy in a massive war game to repel a stronger country that had invaded . 40 employees of the state oil company participated in a similar exercise with 1200 soldiers in 050600 . Pro-Chavez circles here warn of asymmetrical warfare . Asymmetrical warfare is a term coined by [LOC US] military strategists to describe a conflict between unequal combatants where the weaker side employs guerrilla tactics . The [LOC US] government has given $3.3 billion in mostly military aid to [LOC Colombia] in the past 5 years . [PER Chavez] loyalists fear that the [LOC US] government could instigate a proxy war between [LOC Colombia] and [LOC Venezuela] as a way to oust [PER Chavez] and control [MISC Venezuelan] oil . A senior [LOC US] official in an interview dismissed the notion that the [LOC United States] Government wants to invade [LOC Venezuela] as complete and utter nonsense . The official said the chavista side wishes to make the relationship negative because they 've made a political calculation that Mr. [PER Chavez] reached power by constantly being in confrontation with the [LOC US] . Another development that has troubled the [LOC United States] is [PER Chavez] 's rollback of military cooperation and joint exercises . The [LOC US] military had a [ORG Cooperation Office] for 50 years in a [MISC Venezuelan] [ORG Fort] . [PER Chavez] shut it down in 040000 . 5 [LOC US] military trainers and students participating in an exchange program were ordered to leave the country in 050400 . Analysts say that it is likely [PER Chavez] is trying to indoctrinate his public and armed forces . Analysts say that there is no proof that [PER Chavez] will use those forces to aid leftist revolutions elsewhere . 2001-10-05 [LOC South Africa] ( [LOC ZA] ) International ; terrorism ; Government ; money The [MISC South African] government imposed a ban that prohibits the recruitment of people inside or outside of [LOC South Africa] for mercenary or foreign military assistance . On 011006 The Citizen newspaper stated that it is illegal for [MISC South Africans] to be involved in mercenary activity or to render foreign military assistance inside or outside of [LOC South Africa] . The Citizen newspaper stated that the [MISC South African] [ORG Foreign Ministry] announced on 011005 that the [MISC South African] government imposed the mercenary activity ban following reports that 1000 [MISC Muslims] with military training have enlisted to leave [LOC South Africa] for [LOC Afghanistan] to fight for the [ORG Taliban] against the [LOC United States] . A report claims that [MISC Muslims] Against Illegitimate Leaders has claimed that the 1000 [MISC Muslim] men with military training have volunteered their services and have received the backing of local businessmen . Reports claim that all of the 1000 [MISC Muslim] men with military training are over the age of 18 . [MISC Muslims] Against Illegitimate Leaders is a [ORG Cape Town-based] group . The report was refuted by the [ORG Muslim Judicial Council] . [LOC South Africa] 's [ORG Foreign Ministry] stated that [LOC South Africa] 's Foreign Military Assistance Act prohibits the recruitment of people inside or outside of [LOC South Africa] for mercenary or foreign military assistance . [LOC South Africa] 's Foreign Military Assistance Act means that no person is allowed to offer military assistance to any State , organ of State , group or other country , unless permission is granted by the [ORG National Conventional Arms Control Committee] . [LOC South Africa] 's Foreign Military Assistance Act means that foreign military assistance could be rendered only in accordance with an agreement approved by the [ORG National Conventional Arms Control Committee] . The [MISC South African] [ORG Foreign Ministry] stated that any person found in violation of [LOC South Africa] 's Foreign Military Assistance Act or any person that fails to receive permission to participate in foreign military activities could be prosecuted and sentenced to a fine , imprisonment or both . 2002-07-01 [LOC Peru] ( [LOC PE] ) International ; money ; crime ; human rights ; Government ; narcotics ; politics ; leader Former [MISC Peruvian] spy chief [PER Vladimiro Montesinos] convicted of illegally taking control of the [ORG National Intelligence Service] during ex-President [PER Fujimori] 's tenure . [PER Montesinos] has been sentenced to 9 years and 4 months for the conviction . [PER Montesinos] plans to appeal the sentence . On 1 July 2002 former [MISC Peruvian] spy chief during the government of ex-president [PER Alberto Fujimori] , [PER Vladimiro Montesinos] , was convicted of illegally taking control of the [ORG National Intelligence Service] when [PER Montesinos] was supposed to be only an adviser to the spy agency . [PER Montesinos] was sentenced to 9 years and 4 months in prison for abuse of authority . The sentence also ordered [PER Montesinos] pay a fine of 3 million dollars as compensation to the State . Anti-corruption judge [PER Saul Pena] stated [PER Montesinos] has admitted to the abuse of authority charge . This is the first ruling of more than 50 charges against [PER Montesinos] which include corruption , drug trafficking , illegal arms deals and human rights violations . [PER Montesinos] is alleged to run a network of bribes . A leaked videotape showed [PER Montesinos] bribing a congressman to switch to the government party and triggered events that culminated in [PER Fujimori] 's resignation in November 2000 . [PER Fujimori] is accused of dereliction of duty and embezzlement and has been in self-imposed exile in [LOC Japan] since resigning to avoid the legal action from the [MISC Peruvian] authorities under the protection of dual nationality . [PER Montesinos] fled [LOC Peru] in October 2000 but was captured in [LOC Venezuela] on 23 June 2001 . [PER Montesinos] heard the sentence at the [ORG Callao Naval Base] where [PER Montesinos] has been imprisoned since 2001 . [PER Montesinos] stated [PER Montesinos] would consult with a defense lawyer to appeal . 2002-07-25 [LOC Hong Kong] ( [LOC HK] ) International ; Government ; crime ; weapons ; narcotics [LOC Hong Kong] police making efforts to prevent triads or transnational criminal syndicates to engage in criminal activities Recently , the [LOC Hong Kong] police have smashed a transnational theft syndicate , a cross-boundary criminal syndicate and a local triad gang specializing in exploiting youngsters to commit various crimes . The [ORG Oriental Daily News] opined that the recent [LOC Hong Kong] police efforts to cut down 5 of the so-called [ORG Triad] branch leaders or district team leaders within a short 3-week period demonstrates the police 's determination to eradicate criminal activities . The [LOC Hong Kong] police recently has been working closely with the [ORG Guangdong] [ORG Public Security Bureau] for exchange of intelligence and has carried out a series of raids and operations . During 020718-020724 the [LOC Hong Kong] police cracked down on triad activities , including drug trafficking , illegal arms possession , theft , burglary and robbery , the selling of pirated and obscene recordings , dutiable cigarettes and trafficking in dangerous drugs . On 020724 the police dispatched over 100 staff reportedly stormed a propitiation dance and wine party organized to settle some disputes by 2 triad groups at a disco nightclub in mongkok , [LOC Kowloon] . The police eventually arrested 3 branch leaders and 14 core [ORG Triad] members . Police sources confirmed to the [ORG Xinhua New Agency] on 020725 that all 17 arrested are still being detailed for questioning . [LOC Hong Kong] police sources were quoted as saying that the success of the operation in netting all 17 was the result of the police 's effort to infiltrate into the relevant gangs here . Police sources also intimated that more crackdowns by the [LOC Hong Kong] Police on other [ORG Triad] gangs will follow . The [LOC Hong Kong] police 's effort in fighting organized criminals involves actively cooperating with police on the [MISC Chinese] mainland and in other regions . The first so-called targeting Conference of the [ORG International Drug Enforcement Conference] ( [ORG IDEC] ) far east region was held in [LOC Hong Kong] earlier in 020700 . [LOC Hong Kong] was chosen to host the event following the decision of the [ORG IDEC] meeting held in [LOC Bolivia] in 020200 . Some 42 senior anti-narcotics officers from the [MISC Chinese] mainland , [LOC Hong Kong] , [LOC Australia] , [LOC Indonesia] , [LOC Japan] , [LOC South Korea] , [LOC Myanmar] , the [LOC Philippines] , [LOC Singapore] , [LOC Thailand] and the [LOC United States] met . The [LOC Hong Kong] police 's internal news letter recently reported that the conference aimed to provide a flexible and forward-thinking environment for sharing information and taking positive action against the organized criminals of transnational drug trafficking . The [LOC Hong Kong] police 's exchange of intelligence with the police on the [MISC Chinese] mainland has been particularly intense . An 11-member delegation from mainland [LOC China] 's [ORG National Narcotics Control Commission] visited [LOC Hong Kong] recently to study how the police here enforce their anti-narcotics laws . The 11-person team was chaired by the Deputy Director of [ORG Bureau] of narcotics control of the [MISC Chinese] Ministry of [ORG Public Security Chen] cunyi and was briefed by the [LOC Hong Kong] Police as led by [LOC Hong Kong] 's head of narcotics bureau [PER Ip Lau] Chuen on enforced actions carried out in [LOC Hong Kong] . The [LOC Hong Kong] police and [LOC China] 's [ORG National Narcotics Control Commission] also exchanged mutual concerns and discussed a number of issues which included investigations to counter drug trafficking and money laundering activities . The mainland party closed their visit after meeting with [LOC Hong Kong] 's deputy assistant commissioner for crime [PER Yam] TAT wing and held discussions on a proposal to further cooperate in combating cross-boundary drug trafficking activities . 2002-07-25 [LOC Peru] ( [LOC PE] ) Narcotics ; crime ; military ; government [MISC Peruvian] military document discloses former intelligence head Montesinos' links with drug trafficking A document signed by a former high-ranking officer of the [MISC Peruvian] army and disclosed on 020725 mentions links with drug trafficking and could further compromise the situation of the former head of the [ORG National Intelligence Service] of [LOC Peru] [PER Vladimiro Montesinos] . A front-page story in [LOC Peru] 's national daily [ORG El Comercio] said [PER Montesinos] could have authorized the military leadership at [ORG Alto Huallaga] to deal in drugs so as to find the leaders of the rebel group shinning path and the [MISC Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement] . [ORG Alto Huallaga] is located northeast of the capital [LOC Lima] . The story is based on the final report of the Attorney [MISC General'] s office . The Attorney [MISC General'] s Office report collected an accusatory document handed over by an unnamed [MISC Peruvian] army general . [ORG El Comercio] said that in 920000 the government of then-president [PER Alberto Fujimori] put into effect the intelligence operation Scorpion to fight terrorism and drug trafficking in the [LOC Amazon] region . As part of the SCORPION plan several agents infiltrated into the groups to gather information on the main rebel and drug-trafficking commanders . There also were additional orders for transporting cocaine as a cover for the agents . [PER Montesinos] was a close adviser to former [MISC Peruvian] President [PER Alberto Fujimori] . [PER Fujimori] resigned in 001100 over a bribery scandal and is now imprisoned in [LOC Lima] for alleged connection with the scandal . 2002-08-29 [LOC Nepal] ( [ORG NP] ) terrorism ; dissent ; military Soldier injured during bomb defusion in [LOC Kathmandu] after state of emergency expires .

Anti-government insurgents are believed to have planted the bomb . The injured soldier has been admitted to the army hospital in [LOC Kathmandu] . There is no report of any other damage or casualty in the incident .
